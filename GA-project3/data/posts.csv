1,a solo game of gloomhaven takes me to hours mageknight is almost twice that i love the epic character building nature of these games but with family life the games don t get to the table as often as i d like if course on the other end of the spectrum there is dungeon roll this doesn t feel much different than a card game of solitaire it s just a mindless way to pass the time tiny epic galaxies is better but only by a little bit i wonder if other solo gamers out there have a favorite game that fills this middle niche what is your favourite solo character building game that doesn t last too long

1,hello all i m trying to make sense of the new entry in the shasn series azadi for those of you who haven t encountered the ks campaign yet it s the second entry in the shasn line of electoral area control games whereas the original shasn modeled issues based electioneering the azadi entry simulates ideological warfare players are cast as revolutionaries tasked with cooperatively overthrowing an imperial regime in the first act and then competing for the seat of power in the second the graphic design i should mention is gorgeous but the gameplay still seems somewhat opaque to me also while i m politically on board with centering anti imperialism as a thematic framework i m not jiving with the designers over the top marketing language it s as if the game itself is some grand political revolution maybe that s just me what are y all s impressions link for reference azadi your impression of shasn azadi

1,hi everyone i ll admit that this post is motivated out of self interest i m considering hosting a session of fury of dracula and i m looking for some input from those who have played both sides nevertheless it got me thinking about the question of how different game types should have their complexity difficulty measured in vall games like fury of dracula it often seems to be that the bears the larger rules load whereas the all has less to manage so my self interested question is if you were to use the bgg weight scale or whatever other metric to characterize the learning difficulty for each individual side in fury of dracula hunters dracula how would you rate them fury is rated at a on bgg so roughly a medium heavy game leaning towards true medium do you think this adequately characterizes the learning and play experience of both sides as a more general question to encourage discussion what are some other games with divegent roles that make the game more or less difficult for the individual fulfilling that role to grok the game what game in your opinion has the largest such disparity is this a benefit a problem assymetry and role specific weight

1,i recently heard about a new lgs that opened towns over from me as my closest game store is a mall store without much sit and play room my partner and i decided to check it out i always make a purchase when i visit a small game store for the first time even if it s just a snack while i play here is why i didn t this time to begin with i am a female presenting non binary person this has relevance to the story walking into the store i find the person behind the counter without a mask in violation of state mandate annoying but i ll just stay ft away the first words out of his mouth were what are you looking for in a tone that was confrontational i explain that i just wanted to check out a new game store he then asks my male partner what kind of games we play i responded that we mostly play board games and turn to browse the shelves of board games mostly a warhammer store the guy behind the counter then won t let me browse in peace he had to recommend every game in the store at this point i was starting to get annoyed but maybe i ll still buy something i wander back into the large play area and see a large sign with their shop rules this is always a good place to gauge the kind of people who game there the first rule is have good hygiene sooo people who don t bathe game there enough that wash yourself had to be rule good to know down the list i also see no phones out except when necessary for the game well that s ableist so many reasons why someone might need a phone while playing a game dice rollers are often easier for those who have mobility issues communication for those who need tech help for that people with attention issues or social issues they all might use a phone for accessibility not to mention i m a grown adult who can manage my phone use myself thanks then i see no political speech that s a surefire way for the shop owner to just silence anyone they don t agree with and my lgbt fem existence is political they already had a be polite rule they didn t need this rule after all of this i m feeling a little uncomfortable the shop employee has been demanding my attention the entire time i was in the shop kept behaving like i didn t belong there and then he had the nerve to explain what warhammer was to me like i had never heard of it when i told him i used to play sisters of battle he went immediately into sale mode and tried to sell me on the new sisters models all in all i felt very unwelcome the employee attitude seemed to be that my male partner was the one who games and i m just along for the ride it took several instances of him responding to what i said by addressing my partner before he would talk to me and once he started talking he wouldn t let me look around he had to have my attention he tried to explain games to me like i had never heard of them before his attitude made me physically uncomfortable needless to say we left the shop after just a few minutes and purchased nothing we will not be returning we will not be bringing our friends or contacts from the ttg convention we are staff at why i left a lgs without a purchase

1,anyone else feel like there is the potential for too much kingmaking in area control games i play with people that are subject to the cult of the new so unfamiliarity with games also lead to an inability to accurately assess the game state even when someone is very clearly leading the game there is this tendency to ignore the leading player and attack someone else personally it s frustrating for me because wins feel empty and losses feel unjustified is it just me or is this frustrating how do you counter this i realise games are much closer in scores when i play with other people than with this group dealing with kingmaking specifically in area control games
1,as a follow up to the resource pieces i made i ve made my own version of the sets of player pieces for dune imperium my main intention with this set is to capture both more the spacey sci fi vibe of dune and specifically the engimatic mysterious elements of agents and soldiers the agents are both shrouded in mystery and also literally shrouded and hooded from the harsh elements of arrakis the soldier pieces are my attempt at the established rendering of the sardukar as being sort of robotic looking masked super soliders everything else is just kinda years in the future vibes i think the pair well with my other resource tokens gallery here these are made from th inch laser cut acrylic with designs printed on them the agents snap into a small little base so they can stand up right also the original resource tokens player pieces for dune imperium
1,i remember a post here discussing different apps to manage or inspect a collection of board games there was one in particular that let you compare each game tournament bracket style it wound up creating an interesting view of the collection with each game having either been chosen as a winner or a loser to each other contestant however i cannot find a link to that app i didn t save the post nor make a bookmark searching for that discussion hasn t turned up what i remember does this sound familiar to anyone who might have a link to share does anyone have a link to this ranking app
1,i see a lot of reviews for games that are apparently extremely replayable because they have so many cards or so many possible combinations of scenarios etc but i don t think that s necessarily the indicator of replayability the more important part of replayability is a how much fun the game is and b how rich the decision space is take the old classic carcassonne there isn t a ton of replayability by today s definition because of the limited tileset but way back then after my first couple of games boy did i want to get back into it it wasn t because i had yet to see all the content it was because i felt like the mechanics were engrossing and i felt i could try again with a tweaked strategy and do better next time i find scythe is like this too sure it s infinitely replayable modern definition because of all the combinations of modules and expansions and factions and the modular board but it s also highly replayable because of the intriguing decision space sure after a hundred plays you might see optimum strategies emerge it s not a perfect game by the modern notion of replayability chess would not be seen as very replayable thoughts is our contemporary notion of replayability really right tl dr too many reviewers and players associate replayability with the number of games it takes to see all the content when really replayability is about having an engrossing decision space to explore i feel like a lot of reviewers get the idea of replayability wrong
1,if resources time and space were not a problem and you got to open your very own lgs what would have in there i m sure some of us have daydreamed about opening our own store and the things we would want included in it however the reality is opening your store is extremely difficult with the overhead time space and everything else included in starting a small business but what if you had unlimited power in terms of having things in your store what would you do i personally would want a miniature artist on staff you just bought a mini or board game and want to have custom pieces dope here is this artist that can add to your game if you were to open your dream lgs what would you have in it
1,i m very particular now on the things i buy or own because i marie kondo ed the heck out of our belongings and it took several years to get to this point i dislike clutter and i also dislike waste i don t want to invest in a game that ends up being played a handful of times and then completely forgotten about until it eventually gets discarded i got introduced into the board gaming community three years ago and i got hooked i have been slowly adding to my collection my intention is to own a variety of games that utilizes different strategies and accommodates a wide audience for times when we host game night most importantly i have to enjoy playing the game over and over again without ever tiring of it this might seem ridiculous to some of you i understand i have seen some of the extensive collections and while they are impressive and i d love to be invited over for game night i want to be a bit more selective any advice or insight on this would you be able to name your top most frequently played games from your collection or games you would consider classics how did you decide on what games to add to your collection

1,so me and a couple friends really enjoy carcassonne and we enjoy putting a lot of expansions in for more mechanics so we decided let s dedicate an entire day to one singular game and let it have as many cards at possible that s right cards not expansions we used everything we had including basegames rivers and roughly expansions the game itself took roughly hours and ended with the following leaderboard first points second third me no idea why i played so bad my guess is i didn t play aggressive enough to contest big cities and lost a lot of points that way some things of note we were four players but with the amount of expansions we had up to meeple on the scoreboard i noted scores and it took a while to adjust to that also we obviously ran out of markers despite the three basegames you would think that three basegames mean you draw a lot of straight road or other boring pieces but given the sheer size of the board the ability to use these in a good way increases with expansions added and i never felt like i only drew boring tiles everything was surprisingly balanced the only problem were the king and king of robbers which give the person with the biggest city or longest road points for every single complefed city or road respectively that gave players a hundred points each at the end of the game bazars are amazing in such big a game we played on the floor and my knees and butt hurt for two days after however i think there isn t a table big enough to play this on as it can expand in many directions we emptied a fairly large room specifically for this venture the dragon was surprisingly unimpactful eventually everything is really spaced out and if the dragon needs steps in a single direction to reach any meeple it just isn t a threat i think it would ve been better if we played with two dragons but we only had that expansion once half tiles are amazing and i never want to play without them again all in all i can t really recommed doing this but it was great fun and we got really really accustomed to a lot of expansionswe played the largest game of carcassonne we could recently

1,so one of my groups does like to play mysterium and it is a fun game but we all hate the final phase if we get to it because in the final phase you get one shot to guess the final person place and weapon and as far as my group goes most of the time you only get to see one card and don t even know if that card is supposed to be the person place or object amp xb yes you can bet on people s choices in the first phase but you need correct guesses to see all cards and to just see i have only ever seen someone get to once so they got to see cards amp xb not sure how the final phase could be made better maybe someway for the ghost to indicate at least which clue card they are playing like if it goes to a person or something mysterium should change up the final phase

1,my situation is that i have a single x kallax in order to store most of my big box games the engineer in me asks there must be a way to logically calculate the best fit for all these different rectangles into another rectangle it turns out there is there s a math field specifically for bin packing in this case we can represent it in d to accomplish this i measured down to the height and the shortest side of my boxed games i measured the size of the kallax opening i added the bgg ranking for optimizing profit although this is optional i set up the linked bpp solver spreadsheet in excel and ran it then i iterated by don t pack items that i had less desire to see stored some fun additions i forced wingspan wingspan oceania box to be restricted to bin type to keep them together i forced pret a porter and caverna to be horizontal don t rotate since their inserts don t allow it the may be packed selection item doesn t seem to work properly save your dimensions in a separate spreadsheet as the solver one can wipe out all your data quickly this generally solves my problem of one in one out games not being the same size and fitting i m not the author of the spreadsheet but i found it a bit fun to do bin packing combinatorial math for arranging board games in a kallax

1,i went to a friend s house and he had this game when you play as a prison inmate the art looks quite a lot like trailer park boys where everyone looks trashy and has a lot of rape jokes and plays off a lot of homophobic racist stereotypes but i didn t wanted to make a fuss for a minute game and everyone had fun was i a little bit over dramatic thoughts on don t drop the soap
1,if so could you tell me where i need it for my interior design studies have you ever been in a board game shop with a beautiful interior design choices
1,i don t like games that cause players to sit out a game if they die early we played king of tokyo last weekend and a new player made a mistake and died almost immediately the rules as i understand them dictate that when a character dies they just sit there until everyone else finishes the round we house ruled that this guy sit out a round and lose all his purchased cards not his evolution cards he was then allowed to return with full health this was a significant set back for him but allowed him to keep playing and even have a shot at winning the round does anyone have alternative house rules that serve to eliminate the sit there and be quite rule of early death king of tokyo house rule for sitting out after death
1,so one problem i have is the massive stacks of cards that i usually split into stacks to make available while wingspan is less of an issue because of the trays other games have unwieldy decks of cards do you use third party or self made solutions to allow for organized distribution of large stacks of draw and discard piles how do you handle games with large decks of cards like wingspan terraforming mars ares expedition etc
1,hey all i was playing a killer game of mansions of madness yesterday playing as father mateo we were coming up on the end of the session perhaps about to win when the random mythos phase event called for father mateo to take face down damage str negates if successes he has only str if you fail you flip all of your damage face up well i failed which would have instantly killed my character but being hours into a session we decided to ignore it we got closer to the end but inevitably died it was a really good session but ultimately felt delegitimized by ignoring that random event it seems kind of silly that a random event that you have no control over would instantly kill your character especially with how long these games are i also know of one for agatha crane to succeed on str base or take damage leaving her at hp does anyone have good home rules for this game that maybe make these a little less devastating without completely ignoring them or just good home rules in general mansions of madness home rule ideas
1,i ve long been a big sports fan but have only recently gotten heavily into board games and game design it s made me look at sports in a new way and appreciate their mechanics and affectual dimensions for example the amazing contrast in basketball of having such a hard driving physical sport at the same time require the gentleness and precision of shooting i hadn t thought of how special it was that in order have success in basketball a team not only needs to be able to barrel down the court or post up on a defender but have the finesse of a finger roll or point shot the tension that is built in baseball is incredible in the duel between pitcher and batter on top of that the mechanics of baserunning and it s various edgecases are so cool one way i ve begun to ease non gamers into more complex board games is by reminding them that they already know how to play games that have way thicker rulebooks than some of the most complex board games sports i know geoff engelstein did a gametek episode on the way basketball s endgame is broken but has anyone else done this kind of ludologic analysis of sport has anyone else looked at sports in a different way since getting into gaming any sports games that people find really capture the feel of the sport the mechanics of sports

1,we have this one person in our gaming group that doesn t want to learn board games if she see s a game box she ll go nope that s too complicated for me before even hearing any of the rules and so the rest of the group feels that they have to work around her or she ll agree to playing it and then complain the whole game about how she doesn t understand it and when it gets to her turn she ll just sit there going i dont know what to do what should i do until someone leans over and helps her with her turn for example we played gods love dinosaurs a very basic game our turns were seconds pick up a piece add it to our map add critters if need gets to her turn and the flow of the game stops as it s just i dont understand every time or it s time for predators to activate and even the basic movement of them confused her both of these things happened the whole game and we basically had to play it for her this kind of behaviour happens every game that she sits down to play with us how do you accommodate people that seemingly don t want to learn how to play because i m so close to just doing what i can to excluding her because it s like pulling teeth to play with how to teach people that don t want to learn

1,i have a number of games that have gotten split corners on their boxes it s so weird because there hasn t been any significant dropping or damage done to them they have seemingly just sat in a cabinet for extended periods of time wondering if anyone has any strategies for reinforcing preventing those corner splits before they happen any strategies for preventing split corners
1,in this case i m refering to actual in the rulebook mechanics that force individual players to make decisions on their own either with player only information limited comms or some other format for example the crew is co op and uses lack of communication to prevent anyone taking charge when playing i d be looking for something heavier in weight than this but i d be interested to hear anything that follows the same pattern i love pandemic but it suffers badly from quarterbacking i also haven t got great overall board game knowledge and i m relatively new to the hobby so i expect there are some obvious or popular cases that i m just not familiar with and i ask in kindness please refrain from just replying find better players for your group or similar i d rather search this avenue first are there any co op games that have built in mechanisms to prevent quarterbacking
1,hi there i would like to expand my collection i mostly play with my girlfriend and my brothers we started playing mabe a year ago so we are relatively new to this hobby my games are wonders played time wonders duel played over times machi koro played over times ticket to ride europe played over times quacks of quedlingsburgh played over times azul played times kingdomino played times pandemic played over times hanabi played over times hanamikoji played times the crew played over times my gf favorites are machi koro quacks hanabi ticket to ride she loves the luck and gambling in machi koro and quacks friends and brothers favorites are ticket to ride kingdomino azul pandemic the crew do you have any recommendations for us what do you think is missing in my collection that we might like i thought about parks aeons end everdell thanks for the help and sorry for the tipo recommendations for an entry gamer
1,feel free to share your opinions on any field your personal nostalgic reasons to the gameplay and game design perspective how long have you been playing ludo what excites you the most about it

1,hello was curious if fantasy flight games has given any new indication of when unfathomable will hit retail most articles i can find are from the summer and say either q september one source stating halloween which thematically makes sense september is almost over though and i haven t seen any official statement indicating delays am i not looking in the right spot or are most sources just speculative excited to play it unfathomable release date
1,i get it during the pandemic people didn t have a chance to get together so all of a sudden solo modes were important but i think hope a year from now that won t be a concern what i see both pre pandemic and getting together with people now is that often we want to play some big complex games but often people want to play i d love a game that plays great at which many of the seem to play best at but be willing to have a slightly less perfect game to allow that th player to join often the problem with a th is that it s a little longer between each turn and a hour game can get even longer well i think what s worse is have some guy sit out from the group for hours because sorry it s only a player and honestly chatter between players should make that wait before your next turn not killer bad and a good game means your should be somewhat interested in watching what your opponents are up to plus players walking away real quick to get snacks bathroom etc never seemed that bad to me once you hit people it s easier to break out into a pair of players it s not nearly as ideal to pick of the people to break off and then find a decent player game i wish more big complex games games were example voidfall
1,background uwe rosenberg is easily one of this century s top boardgame designers besides more serious games like agricola he had great success with patchwork which is a gem of game for two players where you re placing tetris like polyominoes on your personal board multiplayer games in a similar vein followed more recently with nova luna rosenberg has taken tile laying games in a slightly different direction as rosenberg himself has stated this game was inspired by habitats by corne van moorsel which has players using tiles to build their own wildlife park nova luna incorporates some elements we saw previously in patchwork and is more of an abstract game but comes with the same kind of rewarding puzzly feel it was very well received and was even nominated for the spiel des jahres award sagani is the successor to nova luna and is arguably even better an english edition has just hit kickstarter overview the theme of sagani has to do with achieving harmony between natural elements of earth water air and fire these are represented by spirit of nature tiles in four different colours in turns you ll each place one of these tiles from the limited selection of face up ones available in the process you place several tokens sound discs on this tile and these tokens represent elemental spirits as you cleverly place further tiles to satisfy the positional requirements of previously played tiles you ll create a harmonious arrangement which leads the elemental spirits to emerge and that s what ultimately earns you points the game is all about the enjoyable abstract puzzle of placing tiles optimally in relation to one another to achieve this will you be the first to get to the score that triggers the end of the game by placing your tiles in a way that earns more points than your opponents impressions like its predecessors sagani is an abstract tile laying game that is at its core a spatial puzzle but it offers a fresh feel the game play is easy to learn and understand making it very accessible to play yet despite the simple rules there are genuinely tough choices and interesting decisions making it one of those games that hits the sweet spot of being easy to play but difficult to master this also makes it serve well as a very pleasant game for families and for gamers and even as a gateway game while it can handle more players it is especially good with two players and even as a solo game beautiful components round out a complete package sagani can be described as a streamlined version of nova luna and is somewhat similar to its predecessor yet it is superior to nova luna in many ways including simpler rules while actually offering more thoughtful decisions most people seem to agree that sagani is easily the better of the two although there is certainly room in a collection for both recommendation uwe rosenberg is on a roll with his charming tile laying games with nova luna and sagani he takes things in a different direction from patchwork and his other tile laying games both of these titles offer a very pleasant spatial puzzle like challenge that non gamers and non gamers alike can enjoy if anything sagani surpasses what rosenberg achieved with nova luna and improves on it in almost every respect if you like the idea of a puzzle like game that is all about spatial placement of tiles then sagani is an ideal candidate the good news is that while it was previously hard to get hold of an english edition from eagle gryphon games is coming to north america and europe shortly with the help of kickstarter highly recommended for fans of rosenberg games and those who enjoy tile laying games and spatial puzzles impressions of sagani uwe rosenberg s tile laying sequel to the spiel des jahres nominee nova luna

1,so i picked up aliens another glorious day in the corps game a few weeks ago to play down at my local store with some friends we came into the situation wheir we were at the end of mission escape and managed to get one of the marines to exit and to meet the win condition of getting at least one of the trapped marines to the exit but we ran out of endurance exhaust cards while we still had other marines still on the board and its does say if you pass the mission you can take have of the discard deck and move it back to the endurance deck so my question is did we lose the game as we ran out of cards while characters marines were still on the board or does the characters that managed to leave just before the endurance exhaust cards ran out move onto the next mission without them question about aliens another glorious day in the corps
1,i still haven t picked up this game because price and that i need a new ipad and i have other games atm but i check it out in my local store the store has only sold two copies in the last month and they still have the promos for it so it got me thinking is the game actually successful when you look at google trends like it appears to be as popular as mansions of madness downloads of the app is in the k area there seems to be lots of small evidence that there s not that many actually playing the game what do you guys think does ffg just pretend this thing is selling well is descent legends of the dark a successful game
1,they announced them a while back and i was pumped because i wanted to play unmatched and daredevil is my favorit comic so having a daredevil version of it seemed like a great intro but it seems like they ve never come out and haven t been mentioned lately is it safe to assume they ve beenc anned has unmatched hell s kitchen and redemption row just become vaporware
1,hey folks i m really at a crossroads right now about whether to back this game or not the campaign is about to end soon and i ve currently pledged to it this is the cmon game is masters of the universe clash for eternia the boardgame worth backing on kickstarter
1,the further i ve gotten into the hobby over the years the more i ve focused on getting games that are just plain fun however the game i have the most fun playing isn t my favorite game of all time is it the same for you my favorite game of all time would honestly be lost cities it s so simple and easy to take on trips but so dense with decision making and my wife and i are so evenly matched that it s always exciting the game i have the most fun playing would probably be cosmic encounter it s just chaos incarnate and always brings out laughs and cheers and crushed dreams it s one of the few games where taking a timeout to figure out rules it fun because you re just wondering how the heck everything is going to interact between all of the powers and encounters what is your favorite game of all time and what is the game you have the most fun playing are they the same game or different
1,i m looking to get a new expansion for my collection of ttr games i own usa europe and usa what do you guys think is the best expansion for i would say an intermediate player what is in your opinion the best ticket to ride expansion not europe usa or nordic countries
1,i m pretty interested in the physical board game but i wanted to try it first on my pc to see if i like it or is it better to buy directly the physical game game of thrones digital board game
1,so i know a couple people that when we play they took forever on their turns and i want to see how i can handle it better because sometimes i feel myself getting aggravated and wanting to start quarterbacking their turn i ve been better at controlling myself but i m a person who hates phones at the table and i have to pull out my phone to control the time this person knows they are slow but doesn t help them get any better i just want to know how all you handle it how to handle people who take forever for their turns
1,i m currently trying to design my own enemy cards i am most familiar with the magic the gathering set up as well as gloomhaven and descent what are some great examples of enemy cards from the overall layout to the minutia of information displayed what do you like heck you could even give an example of what s terrible just looking for fun discussions and research to follow up on what are your favorite or best examples of great enemy card layouts info presentations in board games

1,can multiple groups play the same box without affecting each other s playing experience and preferably not leave any irreversible marks in the game that could spoil the fun to the other group can multiple groups play the same gloomhaven jaws of the lion
1,now that the kickstarter launched i m really curious to see where people are at with this game what s everybody s impression on the game right now i m currently in at but strongly on the fence i own both twilight imperium e and eclipse e love both games but they don t hit the table as much as i d like so this definitely feels like it might be an irresponsible purchase for me unless i decide to purge one of those games which would be tough ti is the perfect ameritrash x in my opinion and eclipse e hits just enough of the euro beats to feel like the perfect eurotrash x at the same time i love heavy euros like on mars and anachrony so this should be right in my wheelhouse after reading through the designer diaries this is definitely a mindclash game for better or worse iconographic vomit everywhere typically once you get over the learning hump the iconography is great but that learning hump is there and it looks like this game is pretty heavy on it i have concerns about scaling less so because this is more a straight up euro than ti or eclipse and interaction doesn t seem to matter as much but that concern is still there because none of those games scale amazingly eclipse does the best but i still found it pretty sparse at players i m just sitting here wondering what exactly does this game do other than take a x game and put more standard euro mechanics in place of the typical randomness you get with x in exploration and combat i could see that being appealing to some people but if the x aspect is really just set dressing for a standard euro is voidfall a better heavy euro than all the other options out there but my biggest gripe i think is with the aesthetic i know it s been praised a lot and this is purely my personal opinion but i don t think it looks that great when you see ian o toole s name on a project you expect a really clean look but this game looks overly busy to me everything from the cards to the map just look so busy it doesn t give me that o toole look that i m used to which is disappointing as someone who enjoys his work it just looks like a typical x game to me honestly and this is a huge nitpick but i ve always hated the space tentacles trope in space art i just find it derivative and ugly which i get that it s supposed to be ugly but i just hate it the corruption and void aesthetic just don t do it for me at all i also love asymmetry but i ve found mindclash s implementation of asymmetry to not be very interesting in previous endeavors i ve tried i tried it with anachrony and cerebria i can t remember if trickerion had asymmetry but i just found it didn t really give the game a different feel it just made me have to try and constantly remember all these different tiny rules changes that didn t feel like they mattered in the long term i typically play anachrony symmetrically just because i don t think the asymmetric boards are really worth the extra effort they don t change the feel dramatically enough for me i don t want to be completely down on the game though there are positives and it does look like a solid heavy euro with interesting decisions and i think it has potential and certainly people are very excited by it based on those backer numbers i ll definitely be thinking about it and watching more of the gameplay videos to get a better feel for it in terms of price the version is expected for a x game definitely not out of the norm i would have a hard time justifying the galactic box add on shipping for the all in at a whopping shipped that s a hefty price that i think would be hard to justify even without the add on you re still looking at shipped to the us what do you guys think is this game a good enough x and a good enough euro to justify the high price for the experience are you going all in or are you more on the fence like me are you planning on backing voidfall
1,hi everyone first time posting so lets get straight to it i have a chance to buy chaos at a pretty reasonable price from a dude who s selling it locally and i ve been wondering how the game holds up today what are some pros and cons does it have replay value how hard is it to teach should i add it to my collection also if it is at all relevant my group and i enjoy a wide variety of board games but lately we ve mostly been playing root scythe and unmatched with a little good ol splendor or azul sprinkled in between chaos in the old world

1,hello reddit my housemate bought a copy of unfair a few months ago and we are obsessed though we own a growing collection of games most of the time we only have two people to play games with and we ve just been rotating between unfair and ticket to ride for the most part so i m hoping to find games similar to unfair here s the post on boardgamegeek but basically it s all about hand management building your theme park or as bgg says your city and accomplishing goals listed on blueprint cards all of that i can probably find in some pretty standard games but what i m really hoping for is a modular deck of cards like unfair you use one deck per player chosen from vampire pirate gangster robot etc so there s endless replayability does anyone know of games with a similar modular deck fun themes greatly appreciated but not necessary tia games similar to unfair
1,during my teens in the nineties me and my friends played some board games of the time mostly related to mutant chronicles we had this one person in our group who seemed to have an incredible knack for strategic board games he could read the play field weigh different options in his head and often come out with the most optimal play he won like of our games this even applied to new games where he didn t know all the rules after a round or so he instinctively knew what was the best play for the current situation and often still swept the rug with us now as an adult i have recently joined a board game club and i see the same scenario there are a few players who just seems to be born with it again they often come out in the top even as first timers because they quickly see what is viable and what is not i don t feel i belong to that category in fact i sometimes feel fairly inadequate i have no real problem with not winning or even coming last my biggest gripe is that i can t seem to set up a sound strategy in my head in the end i just wing it and hope for the best it almost feels like when i struggled with math as a child i knew math but i didn t understand it i listened to the teacher did my tasks but when it came to the test i was just dumbfounded if someone would ask how i was going to solve the problem i couldn t answer because i didn t know same with board games i read up about strategies avoid doing obviously stupid things try to have a plan but when i m sitting there at the table my mind is empty or just a mess i can t really explain how i m thinking or why i m doing a certain move why did you place the mine on that planet uhhh i m not really sure it felt right i guess i really envy those who seem to be able to visualize possible plays in their own minds and then actually turn that into a working strategy they also seem to know when to take risk that would otherwise be stupid or making outright bad plays because they can see that it will pay off in the next turn or two is there anyway to train your general strategic thinking anyone else recognize this are some people inherently better players
1,hi r boardgames i don t really play boardgames so it s strange to be here but not nearly as strange as the story as why i m here i work overnight shifts at a convenience store and about half an hour ago i had a frantic man try to barter me some board games for cash long story short i didn t take the deal because i didn t have the money to spare the identification i need help with involves one of the games in question he presented different games in total one in a small black square box that i don t remember much of one called villainous in a green box with a silhouette of maleficent on the front one in a blue box named scotland yard and finally the one i need your help in identifying it was in a large rectangular box taller than inches and probably about a foot long and a foot wide it was a dark red box with gold accents around the edges the center of the box had characters that i believed to be japanese also in gold the only other clue as to what it was is that the guy claimed it was the most expensive of the but i have no idea if that was the truth if anyone can tell me what this game was to satisfy my curiousity i d greatly appreciate it need help identifying a board game
1,the only game i can think of that had this was the wonders th anniversary where it just gave you some extra cards for a low cost aside from that i can t think of any examples even though it feels like a nice cheap way to add some variety to any games with a deck of cards is there some reason i m missing as to why this isn t a more common thong to see how come mini expansions in booster packs aren t more common
1,there s something fascinating about the german version of cartographers specifically about the recent expansion which is called heroes everywhere else and die kartographin the cartographess in germany the expansion shows a female cartographer anyway so it works if you re not involved with germans you probably don t know that there s currently a change in language happening where we re aiming for more inclusion through paying more attention to gender in our daily use of words some people hate this because some people hate change and some people celebrate this i m on the later side for a large variety of reasons so i think renaming heroes to die kartographin is a fantastic and supportive move by pegasus and deserves to be internationally recognized to pegasus renaming of the german expansion to cartographers
1,what are some games on bga that are on the heavier side that still play well on mobile heavy mobile friendly boardgame arena games
1,this is gonna be so vague but i hope someone here knows what i m talking about when i was a kid in the s i played a board game i don t remember what the board looked like all i remember is instead of dice or a spinner you had a matchbox hot wheels type car on a little track you would pull the car back against a rubberband like a slingshot let go and the car would fling back and forth on the track until it landed on a number and that s how many spaces you d move forward i m not totally sure it indicated number of spaces to move but it did tell you what your next move was in some way does this ring a bell for anyone game from s where a car is the spinner
1,not sure what they are called officially sneaky cards and it s predecessor boom boom cards are two examples of one concept for such a game boom boom cards was actually made by someone from my hometown santa cruz but neither really caught on i have played both and find it annoying you have to rely on others to track the cards which rarely happens as people don t know to do so morton s list is another example and while i do like the concept of being a part of a cult of sorts i don t think i would be willing to go so far as to do something illegal hence why the game was banned geocaching is something i do already along with quest scouts i like both a lot and have been meaning to get back in the game sometime soon esoteric is also a game that seems to sort of fall in this category and one i have been considering with all that being said i am looking for more examples of games like the ones i ve listed above if you could help me it would be much appreciated looking for games that take place in the real world

1,so i recently purchased warfighter to play with my son we love military oriented video games and i thought this would be a good one for us since we both like co op board games and card games well is it just me or do all of the cartel missions or any mission at that that require you to use explosive weapons only seem to be imbalanced the starter deck of supply cards weapons available to the players out of the box including the first expansion seem to lack anything that can be used as an explosive to destroy buildings you are faced with either packing a ton of grenades for either your really expensive assault rifle with the under barrel grenade launcher or spending the valuable resource points purchasing as many grenades as you can i am a stickler for following the rules so when my son and i reached the end of our mission we had only two sets of explosives well sadly we both had terrible rolls and they didn t do the damage that we needed them to in order to destroy the buildings am i missing something or do i need to buy another expansion to give us more explosives to use for missions like this we love the game this realization just comes as a disappointment so i am leaning towards the possibility that i am just reading things wrong or doing something wrong because this seems kind of unbalanced for the game to only give you grenades to blow up a building with out of the box i mean c or something would be cool or maybe the ability to call in a laser designated missile or bomb strike but grenades only warfighter modern am i missing something or am i interpreting this wrong game by dvg
1,hi i play a lot of boardgames with my girlfriend mostly sometimes we have people over but rarely so we play mostly games in two people i d say we are experienced boardgamers but we found out lately that we enjoy a lot more simple games with simple setups we have many big games which takes a ton of time to prepare so we leave those for weekends gloomhaven tapestry civilizations we found out that lately we started playing a lot of carcassonne ticket to ride railway inc wonders duel because they are easy to setup and pretty fast to play which also doesn t take a toll on our tired selves we have another game which we enjoy but afaik is made only for our country the name would be diamond forest you put tiles carcassonne size face down and you have to walk on them and find types of diamonds you flip them when you walk over them and then back the first to find the diamonds and gets to the entrance wins it s kind of a childish game but for us is a good relaxation we would like more games like those even a little bit more complex but to still not tire our mind anymore the games can be for more players even card games but as i said we will be playing them in two playersmost of the time thank you for sny suggestion you may have looking for game suggestions based on a few criteria

1,i don t have children so i d like to ask board gamers who do how do children handle losing i m asking specifically about young children years or less what should i consider in terms of winning losing if i m making a family board game are victory points better than clear goals is it good if i make it impossible to score below a certain threshold like the score track is but it s mechanically impossible to score less than and very unlikely to go over even for adults so children don t feel like shit even if they play very poorly is it less hurtful to lose when a game is short how do children handle losing

1,so me and whole bunch of students from my college will be going on a trip soon no worries vaccine passports are mandatory and my country s numbers are low so as a member of the schools boardgame club i have been called on to organize some sort of game related activities to help liven things up during this many hour road trip thing is i ve spent too many hours playing heavy euros and lost all understanding of what an easy and accessible game even is so i ask you for your advice what do you think would be fun to play in this situation it can be small games for people to play in a corner or activities for the whole bus whatever can be played without access to a table or at best some small amount of table and not necessarily face to face any suggestions are highly appreciated disc what games would you play on a bus
1,vasel s law if a game is good it will get a reprint rerelease reskinning in my collection there is a game that i love it surprises everyone i introduce it to because it doesn t look like it will be particularly good it has never failed for me on game night and i don t think it will be readily available ever again that game is warband against the darkness by dyskami games and it doesn t have a whole lot going for it once it s on the table the box has a bright exciting and exhilarating cover showing a band of mythical races charging into battle dust rising in their wake flames and weapons wielded for destruction the back of the box speaks to the war between the races that has been put on hold to fight a common foe and the knowledge that should the alliance prevail someone will be left to rule over the others if you plan properly and fight well that faction could be yours the board however is a generic flow chart next to a generic battle ground split into sections your faction may seem cool but ultimately it s some generic meeples and an art card the evil you face is faceless darkness no real origin nor any real conclusion or explanations and yet when you play it it sings is it the best game ever of course not but it s a game that always fascinates the players around my table always get s played twice when it s on the table and is one of three games i own that make my friends angry because they can t find a copy of it this game should have taken off it should be ripe for a reprint but it s not according to dyskami publishing as of jan there are no plans for a reprint i m not surprised here s why i think there are no plans for it its campaign funded by a mere so it s initial success isn t crying for a second edition despite pretty solid praise from reviewers it didn t develop buzz the graphic design lack of miniatures and sales pitch of euro depth with an evocative fantasy theme managed to alienate euro gamers and thematic gamers nobody is talking about it now and the few who are speak of it in terms of feels like a prototype and needs more of everything this makes me sad obviously but also i have the game so i win i guess i d love to see it re released and blinged up and whatever else dyskami would like to do but if you see a copy of this game somewhere give it a shot i think a lot of people are missing out on a game that they ll love what game is your never going to get reprinted game what game defies vasel s law for you why do you love it and why won t it get a reprint

1,more images here hi all i wanted to share my thematic board game shelves that i made for my hobby room i really wanted something special for my favorite games and something that would act as a centerpiece as well i think that they are about finished i might only add some kind of primitive looking tool for robinson crusoe two bottom shelves contain some of my favorite games and the top one the biggest i have size wise and two more left and right that fitted there top shelf doesn t have any thematic elements well except for the helmet because they would be too high for anyone to see chess set is one of the very first gifts my then girlfriend now wife got me around years ago shelves are made by me only had a friend welding the pipe frame and many things you see on them are scratch built for example the gauntlet is made of soda cans the ring stand is made of tree bark and fake lichen with an led to give it some kind of magical glow and the table light is made out of a wooden planter hope you like it and any suggestions are welcome of course thematic board game shelves more images below
1,does anyone have any suggestions for a board game club for ages obviously there is quite a difference between those ages and i will plan to break them up into groups depending on how many join my thoughts on guidelines are either no cards or cards that aren t used shuffled a lot since young kids tend to destroy cards something that gets young kids excited artwork is an easy gateway nice map pretty tiles etc affordable my list so far kingdomino hey that s my fish some pnps i can print out construct lantern i know this one is technically player but i figure a couple kids could work together but also there might be a few who want to play on their own or even have something they could take home with them planet run also solo only but again i ll try for coop solo i m comfortable making the chits for this one and i think it has a nice design to grab little kid s attention standard deck of cards regicide i know this breaks my rule of no cards but i d only use a standard deck so at least it s cheap also in the sunday august ny times there was a game section for kids and the center spread of imposters in the hive sounds fun and educational so i might bring this along as well did anyone here see that section elementary school board game club ages suggestions
1,okay so it s your turn between the react card you played last turn some card draw cards maybe a potion and the like you ve got skill swords and boots for your turn spread across cards there s maybe a monster in the dungeon row you can kill for more skill and maybe a monster infested hallway you could go down etc how do you track the expenditures of those resources we find sometimes it s a pain to remember because maybe you move one space buy an item kill a monster get more stuff move again buy a device do the thing but wait how many swords did i use do i still have or etc i ve been thinking of little red blue yellow tokens or something anyone run into this tracking your clank turns

1,whenever i see people mention fomo when it comes to kickstarter campaigns one of the more popular solutions i hear is if the game ends up being worth playing it ll come to retail or get another print run for already released games but how true is this what are the top tier kickstarted games that never came to retail that you really wish would for the sake of conversation retail means flgs big box stores not from the publishers own website also what kickstarters were looking like they were going to be the next huge thing that just disappointed everyone or fizzled away what awesome kickstarters never got a retail release what highly anticipated kickstarters let everyone down

1,background although dice have always enjoyed an important role in thematic games serious gamers have often tended to associate them with buckets of luck rather than with satisfying decision making even the evergreen yahtzee tends to be dismissed as something more suited for non gamers but the arrival of qwixx in heralded the dawn of a new era this game had players engaged even if it wasn t your turn and led to a real revival in the roll and write genre qwixx won numerous awards and many successful roll and write games soon followed it one of the most popular of the lot is encore noch mal which was created by markus and inka brand and first published in like qwixx it s a light game that is geared towards a casual game experience and yet offers a fine alternative to the yahtzee crowd it was only a matter of time before deeper dice games in this style would appear one of the best of the lot is that s pretty clever ganz schön clever from designer wolfgang warsch which appeared in it was geared more to gamers and creates the feel an engine builder while remaining a relatively simple dice game while more meaty than what the average family or non gamer is prepared to handle it offers the kind of tough decision making that gamers love with the potential to trigger point generating combos its sequel twice as clever doppelt so clever which came out in was even more oriented to gamers overview bravo noch mal so gut is the sequel to encore catering for players like that s pretty clever it aims to cater to the gamer market and hits the sweet spot for players who appreciate more crunchy decisions it s very much like its predecessor encore where everyone has their own score sheet with brightly coloured boxes which you ll check off on every player s turn when dice are rolled there are two kinds of dice some with numbers and others with coloured crosses and you re trying to finish columns and colours especially ones which generate bonus points like the original game jokers give you extra flexibility but now there s a seventh dice that can be selected and which introduces new elements e g a bomb a heart double stars these give you new options for crossing things off on your scoreboard there are also new scoring opportunities that add further wrinkles and decisions to think about can you achieve the highest score by manipulating both the numbers and colours and make the most of both luck and strategy to your best advantage the essence of the gameplay is basically the same as encore noch mal but bravo adds some more options and more strategies most people will appreciate these additions and agree that it makes bravo better than encore particularly the extra action die improves the game and bravo has more variety and more replayability than the original a small minority will prefer the original game but it can be argued that both games have merits and both are worth playing recommendation bravo noch mal so gut is another fine entry into the roll and write genre and builds on the success of its predecessor encore noch mal but while encore and qwixx are geared more to casual play and non gamers bravo is a somewhat heavier game geared more to gamers much like that s pretty clever ganz schon clever the more meaty decisions means that it offers exactly the kind of crunchiness that gamers enjoy which is a pleasant surprise given that it s a dice rolling game for non gamers i d recommend starting with encore which is an excellent game in its own right but clearly the designers recognize that there is a market for more advanced games that build on the successful design that made encore so good in that respect bravo achieves exactly what it sets out to do and offers a great next step for those looking for a more strategic experience instead of a light and casual game impressions of bravo noch mal so gut a sequel to one of the hottest roll and write games
1,the collection for display the displayed collection with some vague organizational notes we recently moved and had the opportunity to clean and organize our collection there s a number that are kept away in a closet but these games were curated for our go to favorites background i ve been interested in board games for the past years but like many others we never truly got into it until covid lockdown better late than never our initial dive into board games was last march with forbidden island and carcassonne as the main gateways pre lockdown since then we did the classic dive into the hobby and acquired a lot of games too many nevertheless we are rather proud that every purchased game has been played at least once and the vast majority three times or more during that time i have kept a spreadsheet going of the number of game plays approximating the total number of hours and plays that have been done a complete play is when a victor is decided here is the summary of those plays total plays total play time hours total play time days so here we go top ten most played games those that have been the easiest to get to the table or otherwise solid hits carcassonne plays kingdomino plays flash point plays elder sign plays tsuro plays azul plays horrified plays zombie dice plays mansions of madness plays pan am plays personal favorites or rising games i think some of these will eventually pass some of the above games or have just been incredible even if they could only be played only a few times so far dune camel up cosmic encounter eldritch horror akrotiri wavelength alien fate of the nostromo ticket to ride london top solo games no particular order elder sign crystallo deep space d friday marvel champions tiny epic galaxies tiny epic defenders prized possession complete elder sign collection and personally hand painted figures i ll do those in a future post games that will likely join the collection dead men tell no tales we love co ops and renegade has their reprint coming let s summon demons and quacks of quedlinburg changes in gaming taste and lessons learned i initially followed people s advice and tried out as many different games as i could see the large collection in a quick period of time this past year was basically whittling down our favorite vibes and mechanics i suppose it was an investment a very fun investment we love co op games we can play those for hours eldritch horror cthulhu death may die mansions of madness etc i know it s hit and miss for many out there but we got on board with the lovecraftian theme and honestly still enjoying it i work a decently stressful and brain burning job and when i get home i want light fare away from the screen after trying out a number of heavy rules games it was fun to see what they re like but it overall gave a deeper appreciation for the lighter and more elegant games that said i won t say no to a heavier game for instance dune is probably my favorite game if not top it s just not always easy to jump in the new version sounds cool i enjoy painting minis a great lockdown hobby to have learned not pictured our party game collection and about other games that are currently archived in a closet most of these are prepped for the chopping block but we ll keep a few golden ones like star wars rebellion and viticulture all that said do you have favorites from my collection what other games would be a good addition to this bookcase or a new bookcase do you have any questions about any of the games here look forward to hearing your thoughts we moved and cleaned the collection to provide easy access to our current greatest hits what have we missed comc
1,i just picked up and played necromolds monster battles with my two boys ages and and had a blast i saw this kickstarter last year and thought it would be a great way to get my boys into war gaming overview in this game you are wizards creating monster with spell clay playdoh by making them in spell books molds and battling them against each other when one of your monster dies your opponent gets to squish your monster with their magic spell ring components the production value for everything is great the spell books you use to press and make your monster are very sturdy and can be taken apart for easy cleaning they spell books also double as stat and action cards for each monster which is such a smart solution the unique dice are great colors and have clear imagery the spell clay is great quality and i think will last a long while in their containers setup normally my boys hate when games have long and complicated setup but since assembling their monsters is part of the game they love it i get everything ready and they enjoy squishing the clay into the molds there is a simple squad building aspect to building your squad where the amount of clay required to build a monster limits how many monsters you can have gameplay overall gameplay is pretty simple you roll action dice assign those actions to monsters and then active them the actions are very simple move or ranged attack at short medium or long range one complaint i have here is one of the die faces is for an action magic that only about half of the monsters have it sucks rolling multiples of that face when you can t use them there is a re roll option but you lose one die when you do that movement is done with a simple triangle with each side corresponding to the ranges combat is very fast and simple rolling combat die and comparing attack and defense symbols when a monster is killed the opposing player gets to squish the monster with their magic ring this part was my year olds favorite their is an advanced gameplay mode which i haven t explored yet but i m glad it s there for when my boys get older summary overall this is a fantastic game for kids it s got fantastic production value and simple but engaging gameplay i only have minor complaints first some monsters are too overpowered and not all the monsters can use the magic action which makes you feel like you re skipping a turn overall my kids love making and then squishing monsters and it s engaging enough to keep me entertained review necromolds your kids gateway drug to warhammer
1,target is currently selling some interesting game accessories that may appeal to hobbyists i found these in their and below section near the store entrance target has a cheap wooden poker chip set with count each for and denominations it s basic enough for in game currency resource tracking of bigger quantities there is also very basic playing cards that come with a rubber strap band for just a lastly a small basic scoreboard chalkboard easel for keeping track of final scoring or end of round scoring if you have chalk handy i got the poker chip set with some more images i support flgs but the things mentioned aren t something most stores carry anyway as they re very much extras not necessarily geared for hobbyists but could be useful for some for some these cheap accessories can mean more money to spend at their flgs hope this is useful for someone target has cheap game accessories that may be useful for hobbyists

1,for the past few years i ve given my family a board game as a collective gift each christmas first it was ticket to ride then codenames and then carcassonne all of these games have been a hit and i was wondering if anyone had recommendations of other similar games that you have played that it sounds like they might enjoy i suppose what i am looking for is something quite chilled but with a little bit of strategy required something fun and competitive but not particularly intense some games that i have played that i thought they might like are anomia and knit wit but i feel like these are both a bit too party game y and i feel like there are other games around that they might enjoy more i am sure that there are thousands of games out there that i haven t tried and i would love for them to enjoy this gift as much as they have in previous years chilled but fun game recommendations for a gift

1,i really enjoy the wingspan app but have never played the physical game the process of tracking the bonuses and special abilities of each bird seems very tedious i enjoy how the app takes care of it automatically in a real game with four players is there a lot of downtime between turns by the time each player reviews their birds draws some extra cards gets their extra food puts some birds behind some bird cards this seems like an unnecessary feature gains some stuff on someone else s turn and then takes their actual turn nevermind thinking do people often forget to claim a bonus plus how are turns tracked with turns in the first round all of this seems really annoying in a physical playthrough this game is so beautiful and well reviewed i bought the app first to see if i would like it i enjoy the app but i just can t visualize how this is streamlined in a physical play maybe the app means i haven t learned the rules completely but the app has sort of ruined the physical game for me thoughts wingspan is tracking bird card bonuses tedious in the physical game vs the app
1,currently i ve seen two main modes of story telling in board games where you have open ended thematic gameplay that tells its own story something like nemesis xia or merchants amp marauders narrative based gameplay where your decisions drive or unfold a narrative while playing such as middara how effective do you think board games are as a story telling medium do you think board games can create compelling stories in a similar way books movies and video games can what do you think the limitations are what do you think would be cool to see in this realm what are your thoughts on board games as a story telling medium
1,i was just watching latest pandemic game review by the dice tower and ratings are and i wonder why is this isn t enough to rate anything with round number i ve been seeing this for years and just now realized i don t know the good reason for it i think is more than enough i m into board games for years and never have thought about this i have treated ish games on bgg and never gave rating i m sure there s reason behind this but i just can t believe that isn t enough i know there are people with ratings of on bgg but that s just ridiculous why isn t enough for rating the game
1,like i ve seen reviews i ve seen people playing it on youtube but did it ever actually hit the shelves i m in the uk and although i really want a copy plus the expansion i ve had to live with the fact that it would be more productive hunting unicorn turds than it is tracking down a copy of this game does anyone know if it is in stock anywhere on the planet cheers in advance is fantastic factories mythical
1,i have seen kickstarter campaigns for various sorts of luxury painting equipment handles for holding miniatures specialty palettes etc so my question for those who have used some of this painting swag is it worth the added cost are there any particular pieces of equipment that you can t live without now that you have it or conversely are there any that you bought but wound up never using painting swag

1,amp xb after a long work week and getting my two crazy children to bed last night i was finally able to get the transformers deck building game by renegade game studios to the table if you re looking to get your hands on it you can preorder with an estimated shipping date of november and if you preorder directly from them you get a promo pack with some bonus cards they had a limited early release at gencon and i was lucky to find someone to buy it and ship it to me in the solo co op version of game your win condition is to defeat decepticon bosses before the main deck runs out or before you have damage cards you can also play the game competitively more like semi cooperatively where your goal is still to beat bosses but you want to score more victory points by defeating adversaries and their schemes than the other players do i decided to play my first game pure solo as wheeljack since i always liked his tendency to create inventions that blew up in his face and his ears would glow when he talked amp xb unlike a lot of other deck building games where you typically just interact with a market in this game you ll be exploring a grid of facedown cards the matrix as you flip cards face up you ll try to improve your deck by gaining technology maneuvers allies and fellow autobots while defeating any decepticons or their schemes that pop up amp xb this game began a bit rough with a scheme that made all autobots in the matrix into hostile adversaries in order to thwart that scheme i needed to pay energon cubes one of a few different kinds of resources used during gameplay sadly my very first encounter with a decepticon resulted in an ambush where i had to destroy remove from game the starting card that allows me to gain energon amp xb amp xb i recovered and continued exploring the matrix when the first boss popped out soundwave soundwave is especially nasty early as he causes you to take a damage card at the start of each turn i didn t feel confident confronting him yet as i felt as if i needed to get some more powerful cards into my deck unfortunately i ended up revealing a few regular decepticons in the matrix in solo co op mode you can t battle bosses if regular decepticons are on the field i tried to continue developing my deck while getting rid of those low level decepticons and was doing a pretty good job of keeping the incoming damage from soundwave under control unfortunately i also revealed starscream my second boss amp xb starscream compounded my problems as i now needed to discard a card in my hand at the beginning of my turn despite this i was able to hang on for a few rounds while getting my deck to a point where i thought i could eliminate soundwave unfortunately when i began the boss confrontation i didn t have any way of blocking the attack and didn t have a cost card in play to destroy so i took an unexpected spike of damage cards which took me to damage total leading to my defeat amp xb i had a lot of fun with this there are definitely some additional complexities compared to a typical deck builder but those complexities add interesting choices and make me feel like i m actually playing a character unlike some other dbgs where it just feels like you re trying to build a better engine my first solo play of the upcoming transformers deck building game by renegade game studios

1,hi everyone i started playing mage knight a few months ago and love it i m interested in getting a dungeon crawler that gives a similar feel to the things i like about mage knight e g exploration leveling up defeating enemies a final battle high replayability etc that can be played solo and co op and has good depth and replayability but doesn t take as long to play and set up or as much table space i was considering a late pledge for tiny epic dungeons never owned or played a tiny epic game before and would be interested to hear peoples thoughts on if it would be a good choice i also heard about one deck dungeon but not sure how much depth there is in that or if you have any other games you would recommend taking the above into account i would be keen to hear them also posted this in the pg on bgg and the soloboardgaming subreddit dungeon crawler for someone who likes mage knight

1,santa monica is a drafting tableau builder plus spatial puzzle from alderac and josh wood it is utterly charming each card features unique art and the scenes depicted are sprinkled with delightful puns as you build out your street and beachscape you want to be mindful or shuffling your tourists and locals to the places they d prefer to hang out by the end of the game you ll have creates this beachside community with a genuine personality alderac somewhat quietly just released a micro expansion called long weekend that adds double wides event cards plus another scoring towel if you enjoy santa monica already it s a no brainer there s something really satisfying about plonking down a marathon finish line that allows you to move people around or a sand sculpture contest that loses points if placed near wavy oceanside beaches bottom line long weekend is more of the same for a fairly low price adding a couple wrinkles without making things more complex for those who haven t played the base game who is santa monica for people who enjoy games like parks wingspan cascadia those not quite midweight titles that play in about an hour have great components and aren t ruthlessly confrontational santa monica gets a new long weekend micro expansion

1,zombicide nd edition how long does setup take and how much table space does it take up ex how much table space does it take up compared to a typical game of catan or ttr and how many minutes does it take you to setup the game i like zombies as a theme but i m just worried the game won t fit on my table or be too long fiddly to setup and cleanup for my group which prefers fast setup and cleanup games also games like orleans kemet and arcadia quest have trouble fitting on our table so we don t play them as much due to that zombicide nd edition how long does setup take and how much table space does it take up
1,i love a good dungeon crawler and wondered is there was a list somewhere of upcoming ones to keep an eye on is there a list of upcoming dungeon crawlers
1,when playing we keep keep count of the cities and cards so we often know which cities are likely going to be infected the next round as well as how long more to go before an epidemic can occur this allows us to prioritize our decisions super efficiently there are times where this enables us to ignore cube clusters for several rounds simply because we know there s a risk as a result we re done with may already with only outbreaks we haven t lost a game yet and we fully researched all viruses the scientist is also co workers with the researcher so we are sometimes able to research the cure on the very first turn but now our group is wondering if we might have just made the game too easy for us is it cheating to count cards for pandemic legacy

1,i ve played my first couple of games of kanban ev recently and i can t seem to fully grasp what happens to designs once they become upgraded tested there are a few instances in the rules where to take actions it specifically says take a design from your desk such as when moving cars to the garage i take this to mean the slots from the bottom and therefore excludes upgraded or tested designs i m pretty sure this is correct as i m sure i ve even read a response in a forum from lacerda where he uses this to explain the necessity of the non upgradable design tiles the part i can t seem to figure out is do tested designs still count as upgraded designs if not then do you choose how many of your eligible designs get moved to the top of your board as tested designs so as to keep some as just upgraded designs to meet goals etc during meetings if a card mentions basic designs i don t think the rules say specifically from your desk could you count tested or upgraded designs here it ll be interesting to hear your thoughts as there is opportunity to score huge points at meetings and meet goals depending on the rules you use for the above thanks in advance kanban ev design tile placement state
1,veiled fate has a great mechanism for groups that don t like confrontation in the game there are characters on the board each player is randomly assigned one without the others knowing this way no action that blocks or interferes with another character can be construed as an overt action against a player since you a don t know whose character it is and b the character may be unassigned does anyone know of any games with a similar game mechanism games similar to vailed fate
1,so let s say i play a card that splits a dragon s breath ale with the lich king he drops a finger to ignore the card effect this does not say it negates the card merely that the lich king ignores the effect so my supposition is that the drink would still be split leaving me with alcohol but the lich doesn t have to take his alcohol because he ignores it my opposition says this would negate the whole card including the split and leave me with all alcohol which is the case red dragon inn lich king finger vs splitting drinks
1,hello i ve been wondering what people s favorite v games with lane based card play where you have different battles waged at the same time currently these are my favorites battle line schotten totten i personally find this to be ones of the best player games balancing probabilities with you hand draw claiming powers to swing the tide of battle hanamikoji such a tight game where every action seems impactful and it s difficult to know the best thing to do so fast as well healing blade defenders of soma this is a weird one and a hidden gem fantasy themed asymmetric game about bacteria antibiotics i m in the medical field so i ve found this one pretty interesting even if gameplay isn t probably more like ones to try riftforce head to head poker and omen while it s a specific sub genre i think this leads to bluffing and reading your opponent weighing probabilities etc very fun in a v game favorite lane based v games
1,i find that my favorite games are ones that i enjoy the process of playing with little regard to the outcomes while still trying to win getting very good at a particular game involves a certain amount of study and targeted practice at that point it stops feeling like a fun game it d be similar to enjoying pickup basketball but once you re taking jump shots from the same spot on the court to practice it s not quite the same fun activity anymore anyone share this anyone else find that trying to get really good at a game ruins the fun
1,just wanted to start a discussion somewhere for the new steven rhodes board game let s summon demons we played for the first time tonight and already have some questions about rules and such here are some when you have the demon wraithlox in play his card reads other players can t steal from you or cause you to discard cards and someone else plays the demon the devil reads steal all of another player s cards including demons but never candles is the devil more powerful and can take the wraithlox from that player or does the wraithlox over power the devil another question is involving discarding ex the rotten sam card reads you may discard one of your animals if you do collect souls say he is activated and you sacrifice the goldfish it reads you may discard this if you do collect souls would you get the souls from the goldfish as well my thinking is that the goldfish isn t activated so you wouldn t be able to collect its souls but i m not sure any other questions are welcome as well thanks for reading looking forward to discussing let s summon demons discussion

1,hey guys just got secret hitler recently and my group have a few doubts regarding the rules of the game when the chancellor gets the policy cards from the president is he allowed to react usually the reaction is when they want to pretend they got fascist policies and had no choice but to enact one sometimes one might do it to hide the fact they re facist or it could be a natural reaction the group argues natural reactions should be allowed during the policy selection phase can players mention what they re going to do in the next few voting rounds to influence the game for eg if you choose person a as chancellor i ll vote no but if you vote b i ll vote yes basically can voting intentions be mentioned to influence chancellor selections should there be time limits for rounds there have been a few games where liberals took alot of time to discuss and deduce who the facists were should we enforce a time limit for discussions to help the facists secret hitler rules

1,i m talking like a virtual hangout with a big selection of boardgames classic stuff like backgammon and chess maybe a casino section with craps and poker might not be able to get copyrighted stuff like monopoly or game of life but classics and casino stuff sounds great i at least hear things like poker on vr sets is well populated has anyone thought of a board game mmo
1,even among other newbies i can very well be at the bottom tier of scoring at times heck i can still be beaten by first timers despite i have some experience on said games maybe it s just their luck or they learn the strategy better than i do perhaps i m just that easy to pick up games but slow to learn i actually don t mind not being at the top as long as i have fun there are others in the table who has played that game or similar but being at the bottom for possibly playing the game incorrectly or just making bad decisions seemingly the others seemingly don t make that is a very annoying experience indeed someone told me that i need to work on my macro decision making he does have a point sometimes i can get too invested in a plan that i do not consider a plan b sometimes my plan hinges on one thing alone that i will be totally screwed if that particular component goes down the drain i get these tunnel visions probably out of my absolute seriousness and excitement and maybe that s holding me back from winning and very so often i d employ greedy algorithms to win i e rewarding myself through instant gratifications alone and did i mention bad decision making it baffles me on how other newcomers are often better at me at handling that just on the get go or so it seems i ve always had a thing for tabletop gaming and at the same time the feeling aside from being humbled whenever i got the bottom position is me believing that my puny myopic shallow mind isn t good enough for games like these i absolutely adore board games yet i m always bad at them
1,i just met this game at my local pub board game night and i am blown away i also won can t believe it s the most complex but equally rewarding board game i ve ever come across has anyone played i was vagabond given that the outcomes vary so vastly with every play i d love to hear your experiences any tips root found this game tonight at my local pub game night and won

1,i may be way off base here but usually the hot new game that everyone is excited about ends up actually having staying power and being a classic of some sorts that s been my observation of my years lurking around bgg and here maybe i m not noticing the duds or maybe they take longer than years to fade from existence what are some failed games that the cult of new hyped up in the first year or so of its release isn t cult of the new usually right
1,i ve been wanting to post something like this for a while i ve only recently been getting into board gaming and i ve found that many of the games i ve acquired so far can be described as better versions of other classic board games i ve found this can be a decent way to prepare friends who aren t board gamers with examples of games that they probably are familiar with i d love some thoughts on my selections and what you additions to the list chime in here are my comparisons based on some of my favorite games that i own monopoly castles of mad king ludwig market style pricing and economy without the bad stuff clue mysterium risk smallworld settlers of catan everdell what are some comparisons of some of your favorites classics classic modern board game comparison
1,this new game looks fascinating and i m especially impressed by the youtube trailer that does a great job providing background and getting you excited for the story the game is going to tell this in combination with the ongoing zenobia awards is a very encouraging sign for the future of historical games interestingly the game designer seems to go by a pseudonym non breaking space i m not really sure what to make of it it s not clear if it s a new designer or a veteran designer wanting the game to speak for itself i m sure we ll find out in due time if you re not familiar with gmt all of their games are available for pre order on their p system once a game gets over orders realistically more like these days the game is officially greenlit and will be produced often times it takes years for the game to be released once it s available for pre order but this one does look fairly far along already link here gmt games cross bronx expressway youtube trailer here cross bronx expressway trailer youtube summary here cross bronx expressway simulates the socio economic processes of urban development and the human costs that result as a competitive city builder with collective loss conditions players control one of three asymmetric factions working in the south bronx between and pursuing their own goals while cooperating to keep the borough viable through a card driven sequence of play they will work to solve the economic challenges facing the area by building infrastructure and organizations forming coalitions mitigating the multitude of issues facing the vulnerable population and managing resources to stay out of debt cross bronx expressway offers an engaging way to learn about the recent history of american cities as exemplified by jane jacobs pivotal work the death and life of great american cities simulated through the case study of the south bronx players will experience the conflicting incentives and complex factors shaping urban life and together determine the fate of the bronx cross bronx expressway announced by gmt games

1,since the start of the pandemic my wife a friend and i have done two fun boardgame challenges using tabletop simulator in the first challenge we played a boardgame that starts with each letter of the alphabet we just finished the second which involved playing one game from each year from starting with catan until these challenges gave us an excuse to play some classics we hadn t tried tigris and euphrates for caylus for etc and allowed us to discover some hidden gems we probably wouldn t have come across otherwise elfenland from la granja colosseum for the letter c and yokohama for the letter y has anyone else come up with other fun and unique boardgame challenges unique boardgame challenges
1,i know there s merchants and marauders but that s a pretty old game and not very accessible there s forgotten waters but that s a legacy game libertalia is a card game and out of print skull king is just a trick taking game with a loose pirate theme black fleet is out of print plunder a pirate s life was horrendously long and basically just catan i backed feed the kraken and i m so excited for it but it s mostly just a newer and much improved secret hitler i want a great pirate themed game that s medium weight semi euro mechanics and has you sailing ships in the caribbean any suggestions i don t see how the theme is overused because i can t seem to find one that lives up to the potential i ve read several threads that have mentioned pirates when talking about overused themes am i missing something
1,recently received my re theme of hollandspiele s the field of the cloth of gold from thegamecrafter not sure what triggered the idea that twin peaks might work as an alternate skin for the game but i m very happy with how it turned out overall obviously the original theme aligns with the gameplay much more than this will but overall it s abstract enough that i think it works fine i liked that the dragon could be replaced by bob and overall i think this kind of looks like a weird old twin peaks game that someone would find tucked away in their closet this was also a good test for the quality of different items from thegamecrafter as well who i ve used a few times for different things in the past this is the first time i ve had a board created and i m not sure i m in love with the linen finish and am curious how matte would have compared the cards are decent if not slightly thinner than desired but i think that s just consistent with what you get from the company the color and uv coating looks nice overall and i m happy with it the wooden components are fine as expected as i ve purchased a handful of tokens for different projects in the past obviously this doesn t compare at all to the nice canvas board chits and art in the original package however i do think having cards to hold instead of hiding chits behind a screen is a bit more user friendly more pics the original game field of the cloth of gold twin peaks theme
1,hi everyone having a really hard time finding a copy of railroad ink deluxe edition with all of the expansion dice really don t want to pay for each expansion separately when there exists an edition that has everything does anyone know where i can pick one up in the vancouver canada area i ve checked the usual places like craigslist kijiji ebay thank you all for any helpwhere to find railroad ink
1,i have the great honor to live nearby millennium games in rochester ny they have an amazing variety of games great staff and an amazing storefront but they have one thing that makes it truly special a constantly refilling section for used games every week hundreds of used games hit the shelf at typically half or less than standard retail you can pop them open and flip through the components to make sure everything is there and in good condition millennium was my first trip to a flgs and i thought this section was standard in all game stores it wasn t until a few months later i learned how untrue that is now i ve amassed dozens of games upwards of from this used section and have saved hundreds of dollars it allowed my collection to grow much faster and gave me access to many games no longer in print the only downside is the randomness i can t guarantee a game will show up but when something on my list pops up i ll always take a look now the problem i can t shop for games anywhere else anymore i can t get excited about new releases because all i can think is what if i find it used next time i visit i picked up dune imperium and weeks later there it was lightly used and for less than what i paid everything i see is now put next to this used section and feels silly now to be clear i am not complaining this used section is the direct cause of my love for this hobby and i m so lucky to live less than minutes away it just feels so weird now to look at games coming out or kickstarter and think i ll buy it so much cheaper if i just wait it out maybe access to ised games have ruined me

1,hi all looking to identify an old game i had as a child maybe years ago i loved the art on the cards and it was quite unique you were an adventurer seeking to reclaim treasures which were a deck of treasure cards that included things like swords the grail etc you had to venture to various castles dungeons and fight monsters which were drawn at random from a large deck of monsters i think the mechanics were to roll d and get above a certain number depending on your gear but i cannot recall the unique bits you could acquire gear that would make traversing the squares map easier and may also assist with fighting certain monsters torches and ropes specifically were included in this the map unfolded if you reached certain magic vortexes in the middle the game board started off folded and the vortex was a hole in the board once you reached the vortex and initiated it all other adventurers on that board would have or so moves to make it to the middle or they would be killed when the board unfolded i recall the left side of the board unfolded to an air water realm there were several tiles for bridgesid of old adventuring game

1,hey everyone i bought sub terra over a year ago with all expansions my gf loves this game and we ve played it at least times while she would choose it every time i m so burned out is there anything you could recommend that is similar in complexity with coop caveats the theme needs to be fairly real life so not goblins aliens dragons etc we ve tried castle panic and not alone both of which were great mechanics but the theme was hard to care about we ve tried dnd and that was w too much we ve tried forbidden island and that was too simple also we found pandemic to be not so much co op as it was everyone playing every role money is no issue i would gladly pay not to play sub terra for the th time although it is an amazing game and the annihilation expansion is super cool looking for recommendations something like subterra

1,recently i have been wondering if i am failing to get the most out of my games by playing in a way that is too conflict free i love listening to the board game barrage podcast and often hear them discussing the possibilities of blocking each other when they play games listening to them it seems like generally speaking making moves to block opponents is just as important as furthering your own position they make it sound really interesting i just don t play like that i simply try to get the best score i can and then see if i managed to do better than my opponent i mostly play player so it seems like a better way to play my question is do you feel that i am missing out on strategic funtimes by playing like this would i get more out of games if i tried to be more aggressive curious what people feel about their own approaches to play can you play too passively
1,found this dice game at my parents house just floating around and it triggered some nostalgia that i cant identify anyone know what game this comes from it s in memory just out of reach in my brain and it s driving me crazy
1,ride the rails i just discovered the iron rail series and they are fantastic i would probably never buy an xx game but man cube rails are so accessible just like irish gauge ride the rails is dead simple and smooth to play i love watching the map grow out as the game goes on unlike irish gauge this game is more focused on route building and pick up and delivery mechanics and dividends aren t split payout is measured per share so it doesn t feel so bad if someone has shares in a company and you have one watson amp holmes this game is like if sherlock holmes consulting detective was actually solvable by a normal human being i can t believe this game isn t more popular you are each competing detectives trying to solve a mystery the game gives you a couple creative questions to answer about the mystery this is more complicated than just finding out who did it you need to find out how and why as well each player chooses a different location to visit simultaneously and you get to read a blurb usually with some locational clues and interviews with people slowly you begin to form a picture of what happened and the timeline of the events but there is time pressure since the first player to visit sherlock and answer the questions of the case correctly wins the writing in this game is really good usually you can find out who did the murder but you need more evidence and you rush to chase a trail of bread crumbs faster than the other players mandala what a fantastic player abstract game i really have no idea how to begin to describe this so i will link quinn s review of the game here the game is quick and full of weird and interesting decisions its hard to just play a single game of this the only critique i have are the dang square cards they are hard to shuffle and there are over of them i don t understand why you would make this decision the estates the estates is the most cut throat and mean game i have every played this is an auction game with the most amount of room for smart and tricky plays for the simplicity of the ruleset if you are a fan of auction games with high player interaction check this out the production is fantastic as well q e if you ve played high society hs you will enjoy this game everyone plays a trading block usa eu china etc during the reccession you are bidding to bailout companies in different sectors where as hs is a tight game with limited money this game offers extreme freedom money is unlimited and you bid whatever you want with an expo marker the game retains the same genius rule in hs where the player who spent the most money loses the game before even scoring the game does add some interesting set colletion mechanics to the formula the companies you are bailing out have an associated country and economic sector manufacturing financial housing etc so the industries will be worth different amounts dynamically depending on the players i would call this a great party auction game not as serious as a train game but man is it a good time favorite games with a bgg rank i ll start
1,i ve been considering getting a new game and i thought i d see what you would recommend res arcana roll player lost ruins of arnak i d like to know which is best for players as it s usually just me and my wife and here s some other games we play a lot too give you some idea of our tastes wingspan tiny epic galaxies love letter unmatched villainous aquatica eldritch horror thanks narrowed it down to three

1,i like to think i m a pretty intelligent guy i have a degree in engineering i know how to do a lot of things and i think very deeply about games strategy and mechanics and yet i can think of a long list of examples of games where i was the lowest scoring player not just that i didn t win but that i was dead last there have even been times on more than one occasion where i ve been playing a game and there was a complete noob playing who scored higher than me as in i probably could have scored better if i had played randomly rather than whatever strategy i chose there s been so many times where we get to the scoring phase of a game i m second to last or somewhere in there all the points get totalled up and every single player i was ahead of somehow has a cache of points that puts them ahead of me there s this feeling of dread and dissociation i get when i look at the scoreboard at the end and see my token in last place it s really killing my enjoyment of games i don t have to win i just want to not be last every single time it s to the point where i only want to suggest cooperative games or games where there isn t scoring just one winner i guess i m just looking for some commiseration to know that i m not just a secret idiot and maybe i just think differently than the average player i m consistently the worst player in my gaming group
1,hello i have a weird hobby of retheming games that i like i usually take a game with bad components or bland theme to me and i do all at once re theme components upgrade and translation my first concern is the theme must match the mechanics and i often find myself thinking about different possible themes for weeks before starting something my next project is concordia i have narrowed down options and i m not quite happy with either i started some art for both ideas but before going further i need to select something final help agricordia modern agriculture theme cities are now fields where you move your tractor mud roads or pickup truck normal roads to build barns ressources are things like wheats potatoes corn cards in concordia are actions plus scoring mechanic they are bought at the market my cards would be jobs machinery hybrid like harrow combine farmer mechanic accountant what i don t like buying a combine harvester with potatoes seems wrong discordia social network meme theme cities are now internet forums where you move your trollface didn t find the boat equivalent yet to build flame wars flame emoji ressources are things like disinformation personal data hatespeech likes karma cards are classic memes reflecting the action for example distracted boyfriend for diplomat copy others action sad pablo escobar for tribune skip turn take back cards fry throwing money for senator buying new cards what i don t like this will probably not age well so which one would you be more interested playing do you have a killer theme that would fit concordia even better note i bought every original games before doing a retheme so far to support designers and to try the game first which retheme of concordia seems the most fun to you
1,hey all i finally bought into the wonders hype yeah a few years behind i ll admit when i saw how pretty the nd edition was i tested with my game group and my family and it was a hit on both sides i decided to get the cities and leaders expansions as they appear to be everyone s go to s here s the issue i live in canada and cannot find more of the gamegenic matte sleeves i have the base game in at least at a reasonable price and will likely be about half a pack short of sleeving everything am i correct in assuming i could sleeve the leader cards in other sleeves and this would have no impact other than grating on my ocd as far as i can tell the leaders are drafted on their own and don t mix into your hand or am i wrong thanks wonders question regarding expansions

1,the terms eurogame and the kinda lovingly derisive ameritrash are much less used today than or years ago european games have gotten more thematic and colourful american games have gotten more elegant in design and less random generally but many games these days people can still point to and call it more of a eurogame this is because of the mechanics at the heart of these games so my question to y all is what mechanics do you associate with eurogames what mechanics do you associate with american style games and do you associate certain with lighter games of these styles or heavier ones for example is worker placement a heavier game or a lighter game mechanic what mechanics do you associate with eurogames vs ameritrash
1,my tabletop group has slowly moved into more complex games but campaign and legacy games are still uncharted territory for all of us we had a d amp d session but it didn t work out too well so i figured that maybe a campaign or legacy game would suit our group better i m aware of the highly regarded gloomhaven and pandemic legacy but i m looking for moderately priced moderately long moderately complex games that would leave our group wanting for more if it was up to me i d just pick up gloomhaven but i m afraid it might be a tad too much for some of our members who have less experience in such games we do enjoy card and dice mechanics gateway campaign legacy games

1,hey all i checked the sidebar and didn t see any rules specifically addressing id requests so i thought i d give it a shot if this isn t acceptable content or if anyone knows a subreddit geared more toward iding games please let me know amp xb around my dad got me a board game for christmas it came in a standard sized rectangular think monopoly sized box and the theme was similar to dnd or like a fantasy dungeon crawler adventure game i opened it up and was in awe of what was inside there were seemingly dozens of pieces including a ton of cards that represented monsters the most distinct of which that i can remember was a weretiger card sadly i don t remember the rules or much more about it i want to say you could arrange the map with tiles but i could be misremembering that detail what i do know is that it seemed to my year old brain to be really complex and look so fun unfortunately i never got to actually play the darn game because i was in the middle of moving towns so no real available friends and my older sister couldn t have been less interested i m hoping to figure out what it was so that i can at least look it up and possibly even purchase it again i have no idea of the title or who made or anything i realize this isn t a lot to go on but it would be amazing if anyone could help me in figuring out what this board game was amp xb thanks in advance hoping for help identifying a board game i played years ago

1,so chip theory s announcement of the standalone expansion through gamefound has me interested as it sounds like a less expensive entry to tmb which has been on my radar for a while but is cost prohibitive at the moment my biggest concern is the replayability level of tmb i know there s a lot of content but most of it looks like extra characters which to me don t add that much replayability for a story telling rpg i m not likely to play through an entire story again just because i got a new character unless the character itself adds story as well is there enough content here to get my money s worth out of this game about how long is a single playthrough of the content that s available is it fun enough to play as just single skirmishes or is it really built for campaign style play too many bones replayability

1,why i am excited about the new version of pergamon so a second edition of pergamon is coming out this game was first released in and was created by two designers whose games i love stefan dorra creator of for sale and ralf zur linde creator of finca with pergamon they had teamed up to create a player game where you re an th century archaeologist excavating the ancient city of pergamon what s good about the game one of the stand out features of pergamon for me was the clever way that this family style euro game had players digging up and literally piecing together fragments of ancient artifacts which you display in a museum to earn points it s a brilliant concept that evokes plenty of theme and works well as a game mechanic the way all the mechanics others include set collection and bidding combine and are integrated with the archaeology theme is a stand out feature of this game in terms of the subject material pergamon draws immediate comparisons to another popular archaeology game with a digging theme namely thebes while pergamon doesn t have the same press your luck and yell out loud highs and lows of thebes which has players literally digging for treasure from a cloth bag what it does do better than thebes is produce a less frustrating experience for those who feel dissatisfied by having their strategy decisions trumped by luck of the draw the game play is easy to learn and quick to play making pergamon well suited for families and yet there are genuinely strategic decisions which also make it satisfying for gamers another strength is that although the game is tailored especially for players the two player game is excellent and pergamon is still worthwhile getting even if you only ever play it with just two it also has terrific components that strengthen the theme and enhance the gameplay it s a fine overall package of components theme and gameplay and unsurprisingly received considerable praise when it first came out besides all the praise there were a few criticisms of the original pergamon for a small minority of gamers their overall experience felt a little flat and lack lustre while others would have preferred the gameplay to have less luck and more tension in some instances they also felt that the game went on a little longer than they preferred but even those who weren t charmed by pergamon did have very good things to say about its components mechanics and theme and any critical comments were more than outweighed by those who embraced the game with a lot of enthusiasm changes in the second edition the original edition of pergamon did have some small points that could be further polished so when i heard that a second edition was coming out this year with the help of kickstarter on september i was immediately interested the publisher has produced a few pre publication copies and in view of a detailed pictorial review i d written about the original edition i was invited to check out an advance copy of this second edition i was only too happy to accept and was fortunate enough to get my hands on a copy so why am i excited about the upcoming second edition well firstly because this basically takes what is already a successful game and keeps what s good about it while fine tuning and upgrading some small elements in my original review i had flagged a few minor things that could be improved most of which were cosmetic custom archaeologist rather than generic meeples using the conventional bc rather than ac system of referring to dates and a few inconsistencies and mistakes in the rulebook i also made the suggestion supported by the designer stefan dorra as it turned out and many other gamers that the optional variant about turn order be the standard way to play all of these things have been fixed along with several other component upgrades in addition designer stefan dorra has also made a number of changes that help improve aspects of the gameplay in several areas the biggest of these is how artifact tiles are dealt with these now go into a bag instead of the calendar at the start of a game and some random ones are placed onto the calendar at the start of each round half a dozen new exceptional artifact tiles have also been added to the game the upshot of the rule changes is that the game begins with some initial momentum and excitement due to the artifact tiles on the board at the outset the adjusted turn order also makes the game smoother and is a welcome improvement the other changes and adjustments just streamline the overall balance and flow of the game in subtle ways which generally gives an improved sense of gameplay there s also a new mini expansion called the antiquities trade expansion that comes with the second edition of the game which is designed to add more tactical elements to the game play it adds four trade tokens which begin the game in spaces and of the research funding track landing here gives you the opportunity to either purchase an artifact tile from another player or sell one of your artifact tiles to another player final thoughts pergamon was already a terrific family style euro game in its first edition one positive about the second edition is that it should generate some welcome attention to a clever fun and thematic game and will introduce it to all those who only embraced modern board games in the past ten years and have likely never heard of pergamon up until now so there s a ready audience that simply hasn t yet had the opportunity to discover or play this fine game yet and while the original version was already good this second edition only makes things better the components are especially delightful and not only are they very functional as far as gameplay is concerned but they also look very attractive there s great attention to detail in both the artwork and the graphic design which really helps enhance and bring out the theme and there is a lot of thematic flavour to be found here while pergamon is ultimately a euro game the theme doesn t feel pasted on but is closely wedded to the mechanics in many respects this isn t your typical cube pushing euro but genuinely immerses you into a game where you feel like you re collecting archaeological fragments piecing them together and exhibiting them one thing i really appreciate about pergamon is how it gets just the right blend of luck and strategy there is an element of luck and let s be honest that s thematically appropriate for a game about archaeological digs and the game wouldn t be as good without it but it can it be mitigated by reducing the risk factor of your decisions and playing more conservatively and there are real decisions to be made which will ultimately determine the winner and while there is real strategy here pergamon is still a game that remains very accessible to a wide range of ages the gameplay is easily learned and understood and it also plays quite briskly so it doesn t overstay its welcome recommendation it s appropriate that a game that has you polishing your artifacts for exhibitions has now received its own coat of polish and the results are excellent but don t just park the well polished second edition of pergamon on your shelf to collect dust bring it out on your gaming table and enjoy it with family and friends on its tenth birthday this delightful game has matured nicely and should bring joy to a whole new generation of gamers that have never come across it before while also giving existing fans something to applaud impressions of pergamon and its upcoming second edition

1,we read a green card at the beginning of game that prompted us to read one of three blue cards or each of those cards will result in us covering either or spaces of the basic resources excluding gold however my friend and i were confused as bc we are playing the p campaign we had to cover of the spaces of each basic resource should we still cover additional spaces as prompted by the blue card bc that seems somewhat harsh that would mean for example using card i believe we would cover additional brick spaces leaving only brick for the rest of the game please let us know what we re supposed to do here as we are confused p rise of queensdale clarification epoch spoilers

1,you might all know the game star wars rebellion and the stories the gameplay tells let me tell you from our battle last night to set the scene the rebels were very desperate running and searching for a nice hiding spot units and objectives to achieve the empire was extremely savage and removed and conquered all planets and units of the board quite easily this left the rebels with an hidden base but an open secret in nal hutta the round prior the rebels just defeated at sts in toydaria with a suicide squad of transport and rebeltroopers and the help of luke skywalker and his one in a million action card relocation at the end of this round was not possible so they were left with sympathy at the start of round more sympathy and surviving was all that was needed to win the rebels were able to prepare for battle with their last action to get all their battle cards back but the board was not looking in their favor a big fleet approached from naboo and the last units on nal hutta were transport a nebulon b and trooper recreation start of the round luck wasnt on their side as they pulled the heart of the empire objective and other unfavorable objectives in hand thats what they thought there was a small chance but everything had to work in their favor with a first action obi wan attacked a star destroyer and assault carrier in toydaria to get trough the blockade with the help of nebulons tactic card it sacrificed itself to let the rebel transport retreat to kashyyk and meet with a single rebel trooper a transport and a trooper the last hope to beat an overwhelming empire obi wan led the squad to retreat into kashyyk as savage as the empire was they wanted to remove everything from the board a star destroyer an at st and a stormtrooper from mandalore should do it the rebel transport survived and there was no ground battle as the trooper and transport fled with the help of the transport tactic to alder the empire trying to wipe out the rebels again retreating meanwhile the big fleet from naboo was closing in and vader was working on removing the sabotage from bothawui but he did not expect an undercover mission action card obi wan moved from alder to bothawui to oppose his rule by fear obi wan failed but winning wasn t his goal vader is suprised by an undercover mission now the transport and trooper were free to move to coruscant luke led the force and with a single damage from a tactic card the lonely x wing was defeated there was no ground battle as the single stormtrooper was removed before battle and luke is free to conquer coruscant it damed on the empire that there was no transport in the region to regain control of coruscant and it desperately moved units around to close in but it was too late at the end of the round the objective was revealed giving the deemed impossible points to the rebels star wars rebellion last hope

1,this past weekend my wife and i went to gen con in person for the very first time we went online last year we heard from others that this year would be very different but coming in with a fresh perspective we wanted to share what we saw when we entered the convention hall we were greeted by wonderland board games everywhere of course there were a few publishers missing all the asmodee groups brotherwise games a few others and it supposedly wasn t as crowded definitely wasn t shoulder to shoulder but the ones that were there we proud to show off all the games they ve made not only recently but in the last years many of these games released in were seeing the floor for the first time what i found was the experience felt really special every interaction felt intentional people were excited to share conversation about board games again strangers were so excited to dive into learning new games together in the open gaming hall and we discovered so many games that we had never heard of despite them coming out over a year ago it was also open enough that you could pretty much walk up to any booth and within minutes get to sit down and demo their newest games i really felt like i got to see a lot it felt like going to disneyland on a work day in off season and getting to ride all the rides it was great to talk to designers about their games and ask them why they chose the themes they did what their favorite twists and mechanics were it was great to hear how passionate they were piles of sleeping gods copies got signed by ryan laukat the dice tower live event was a blast zee is hilarious great comedic timing later in open gaming we d be sitting playing games and designers like eric lang and youtubers would come by to see what people were up to it was a truly special experience and i am so glad to have gone some favorites we saw there included the rocketeer paris la cité de la lumière rift force merchants of the dark road blitzkrieg reprint horrified american monsters strike and more anyone else go what were your thoughts my first gen con experience

1,hi my question is not entirely what s an alternative to mk but moreso asking for recommendations i m quite new when it comes to modern boardgaming i ve always been interested but didn t have any friends that shared the same interests recently my wife and i started getting into some more popular games and have been adding to the collection very quickly i m currently looking to scratch the solo itch when my wife isn t down to play on a given day mage knight of course was the game that came up in almost every post after looking at some gameplay i can see how invested the game can make you feel but i m concerned about the length as some have alluded to the rulebook of course and the combat didn t look like it was my cup of tea for context i own aeon s end new age and i absolutely adore the combat the enemy ai and the nemesis deck system something i feel might be missing for mk from what i ve seen one thing that made me consider it was the tile exploration something i m really keen on so ultimately i m looking for something that has prodedural modular based exploration no one and done campaign preferably deck building with the combat depth of something like aeon s end maybe this game doesn t exist or maybe i even overlooked some that has come up in my search including mk thanks in advance yet another similar to mage knight post

1,i absolutely love a player aid it s this little bit of comfort that you can hand out to people around the table it can keep them on track help them understand complex iconography remind them of their options i m dissapointed when games don t have them however at what point does the player aid become more than just an assistant as i get deeper and deeper into this hobby i m starting to see more and more games that rely on the player aid as a crux as a part of the main game that you probably can t play without is this a bad thing i m not sure i recently bought la granja a really fantastic and complex euro game with one downside the player aid is essential to play the game la granja player aid la granja has steps in a round all mechanically and thematically disconnected it s almost impossible to commit it to memory it got me thinking was the game designed with a player aid in mind is there a better way this information could have been presented could the player aid have been used for something else some types of player aid games that use them to translate their own convoluted terms for things transpose pick up a cube games that use them to explain complex symbology games that use the player aid to remind you of the options available games that have unintuitive round structures with unrelated sections thematically and mechanically and use the player aid is a tick list of actions games that use them to help with scoring games that have huge player aids with practically the entire rules on them and many many many more so some questions to think about what makes a good player aid to you how can board game designers best use the player aid without relying on it as a core aspect or alternatively would you prefer player aids were bigger and more integral to the experience with the example of the check list style player aids do you think they should be better incorporated into the base game e g viticulture where end of year steps are laid out on the board or thematically obvious through progression of seasons what are some your favourite least favourite player aids the role of the player aid when optional becomes essential

1,i was stumped today when someone asked me what other games were like the race for good spaces on the map and trying to confirm awards while building cards in the service of doing both more efficiently and also getting points by spending money to hit the terraform button they weren t interested in just tableau builders they wanted a game that had a competition for both a map and objectives which are points while constantly looking at new ways to accomplish those more effectively each round they didn t care for the engine building by themselves if it wasn t for standard actions being effective on their own terraforming mars is the only game that i can think of that has a contested map with a race for awards and milestones with an engine builder

1,my buddy and i were streaming board games from bga and came across chinagold which had some highly questionable box art going through the designers game library the publishing company he runs changes the logo based on the location of the game but for some reason uses chinese caricatures for the number of players age etc also some of the art in some games seems questionable like old town robbery using a bad caricature of an native american are we going crazy it seems like this hasn t come up before games by gunter cornett

1,i enjoy playing board games and i even enjoy teaching them however some people take too long to absorb information which renders playing complex games with them a chore on the th turn they are still asking why x happened even though it happened and was explained on all previous turns however whenever i play with developers i notice that they learn really fast and i usually never have to repeat a rule not even once amp xb some musings for discussion why is that is it practice programmers spend lots of time reading documentations and code which are not very different than books of rules is it personality i fell like slow learners usually aren t paying attention they like to interrupt the teach with questions usually things that i will obviously still cover imagine there are blue yellow and green tokens i start explaining blue tokens and they ask what about yellow tokens or have just covered maybe this personality will make it impossible for you to be a developer so natural selection kicks in is it geekiness developers like computers gt video games gt games therefore they have lots of experience with multiple game mechanics so the overhead of learning a new game is actually just putting together previously mastered concepts amp xb i wonder if teaching someone how to play a game could be a good predictor for good dev skills maybe an interesting way to improve tech interviews i have always joked with my team that i would eventually add a factorio phase on our interview process programmers learn board games really fast anyone noticed that

1,hello everyone amp xb as the title may suggest i am looking for a game that plays similarly to heroscape by that mean a game that has the following properties it is a limited resource game where you can create a warband from some pieces and then fight other players warbands but do not get any more pieces as the game progresses it is a game that can be played with players v but also works well or decently well with more players players specifically or players it is a game that can be completed in or fewer hours it is a game that one person can buy and everyone else be able to play it is a game that is not too expensive max any suggestions some ideas i have come across are summoner s wars which works fine with players but often our game nights are or players additionally the magic version of heroscape is a possibility but if my friends and i want to play a magic themed game we would just pull out some commander decks and or planechase instead thanks in advancedlooking for games that play similarly to heroscape

1,given recent events i think pandemic should consider adding an expansion with the following rules misinformation events and a misinformation track on every turn someone draws from the information deck it could be something useful like media promotes vaccines and distancing or celebrity credits vaccine with helping them stave off infection or it could be something harmful like media megacorporation encourages vaccine skepticism and promotes violence against local officials listening to experts or nicki minaj said here cousins uncles hamsters babysitter said his friends balls got really huge after getting the vaccine refusal events tied to the misinformation track are refusal events which are placed in the player deck and behave like epidemics refusal events happen when a group of citizens refuses to listen to the experts and just does whatever the fuck they want to in the event this happens a city is placed at max cubes of their color and the outbreak track is moved on to combat this add a new role the information manager their job is to make sure that all the information out in the world is correct they will have the ability to mitigate a refusal or misinformation event by playing the card of the city in question if the misinformation track maxes out the infection rate increases faster idea for pandemic expansion given new data irl

1,so my girlfriend and i were playing parcheesi and came upon what i thought was an ambiguous rule i began by rolling double s entering two pawns and forming a blockade and rolling again due to the doubles i then rolled a and a six moved one of the pawns forward six and entered a third pawn to form a blockade again now the rules say you can t move a pawn threw a blockade but my interpretation is that i didn t i broke up the blockade of the first two entered pawns and then entered a third my girlfriend says i can t enter that third pawn because a blockade was there to begin the turn what do you guys think as an aside i agreed with her way of playing after a little pushback since i m not about to be a dummy over parcheesi parcheesi question

1,i ve seen multiple videos about ankh recently that talk about how the infamous merge rule is causing some discussion it got me thinking about republic of rome and how your citizens can die randomly for all the rules in both games it feels like those stick out as ones you have to teach people and explain some implications partly because of their implications for play but also because some people will not want to play at all i was wondering are there other games like that what i mean is a single rule that you need to make sure to explain to people and let them opt out of the game if that is a serious deal breaker for them amp xb at a certain point the the two last place players are merged into a single faction with the dead last player losing most all of their pieces one off putting rule
1,i m designing a board game and i don t want to make one if there is one already are there any games that are like a stereotypical adventure movie
1,this game is truly a gem it is a lot of game in a small package with a very reasonable price tag such a nod to older beige euros but brightly colored player pieces the resources are nice wood bits and very nice jewels think bedazzler the decisions are meaty without having too many options on your turn or any edge cases the random setup makes for a very replayable experience there are dice in a rondel but the luck is low in this game and the small amount of luck is easily mitigated the game scales fantastically between and players there is a solo mode included as well but i haven t tried it yet this box is so small it really travels well can t say enough good things about this game some love for the red cathedral

1,over the past few months i ve been introducing board games to a few groups of friends with varying levels of experience some players are completely new to modern board games and so i ve been slowly introducing them to the different mechanics to ease them into it my thinking was rather than throwing them into lost ruins of arnak why not play summer camp to teach deckbuilding and everdell to teach worker placement so at least mechanically it s not unfamiliar to them and they can focus a bit more on strategy or even having fun instead of struggling with a mechanic they haven t seen previously i thought it would be fun to design a curriculum around the different mechanics before graduating to more complex games for example we played summer camp before playing fort tiny towns before isle of cats what are some games or mechanics that you would include or have included to help ease your friends into the hobby designing a board game mechanic academy

1,board games card games i was mostly looking at getting wonders duel and munchkin lite i ve heard munchkin isn t great but it would almost exactly finish off the gift card and i ve always been a bit curious about it or the other thing i was looking at getting is catan my only concern is that i mostly play with players and i might not get to play this one as often with it s player requirement they also have the arkham horror lcg which does strongly interest me but i ve heard it s not great with one core set and that it s really not worth it unless you re willing to invest also the new core set comes out soon so i might for that anyway any advice or recommendations other than these also i already own pandemic i have a hot topic gift card and a off coupon what game would you recommend

1,i ve always been a huge fan of guild wars an old school online rpg and a few years ago i found out that the skill system was actually inspired by magic the gathering mike o brien one of the designers of guild wars we looked around for role playing games that weren t all about numbers going up in our search we were inspired by magic the gathering in magic the more you play the more abilities you acquire but that doesn t make you strictly more powerful than other players you pick and choose abilities from your collection and your choices determine how well you do this is exactly the feeling when playing guild wars you collect skills there s around of them but you can only use up to at a time therefore creating a need to strategize to make a good build for me this created an rpg that s very different from what was out there after many many years i became a game designer and started working on an idea for a rpg game then that idea actually became a card game aiming to replicate that experience of playing an online rpg in order to give that real time combat feel i ve designed ambal tournament with simultaneous rounds and even during the battle phase players select their cards at the same time so it felt like a full circle moment when i realized that guild wars which is inspired by a card game inspired me to create a card game even though my game plays very differently than magic it s kinda funny to see inspiration bounce between tabletop and digital games do you know any boardgames inspired by videogames besides the obvious adaptations using the game s name a video game inspired my game then i found this out

1,what is the board game with the biggest box or biggest board you know just curious big boys
1,how often do you play cooperative games with strangers for example at a board game night where you don t know many people i was wondering if there is a phenomenon of competitive games being played more when you play with strangers simply because it feels a bit weirder from an anthropological sociological point of view to cooperate and play united with people you don t know well or don t know at all my question is if you feel that relative to the percentage that cooperative games make for in general over the totality of games these type of games are played less than what they should in some specific context for example let s say that only game out of is cooperative among the ones that are available at some board game night are in your experience these games played less than out sessions or are they played normally in proportion to how many there are available is there a tendency to play less cooperative games with strangers yes no why

1,mine is the battlestar galactica board game and all expansions also please recommend me some good shelving for boardgames i have a good collection going and would like to put them in some good shelving whats your prized boardgame possession
1,this is not a knock on innovation this game is incredible and so much fun but it s been hard for me to scan my hand and the board quickly for dogma effects especially the other player s board the effects are mainly text it hasn t been that big of a deal but it slows the game down if you want to play at the level of being aware of every card in play possibility until you ve played enough times to know all the cards well fortunately it s good replayable enough that most players will get to that point so it s made me realize that gosh race for the galaxy s symbols save so much time during gameplay and lets you become familiar with all the cards so much quicker the useful redundancy for different visual scans and the ability to read the cards upside is just now blowing my mind it really would have inhabited the game to have just written every out instead i m not sure if the dogmas in innovation could be made into symbols but it does make me wish for it anyways they are both excellent games just wanted to share something i ve been taking for granted innovation has made me really appreciate how genius the symbols in race for the galaxy are

1,i just recently purchased red dragon inn and was playing with some friends and we had a situation come up i dont think the rule book fullied covered we were in the midst of gambling and due to the cards that were played each player antied gold each right before the winner was declared one player played the card that stated when he was about to loose gold he could use gold from the inn instead and keep his gold his interpretation was because he technically didn t loose the round of gambling yet and his gold was in the pot it was still technically his and he could use the card to regain all gold he initially placed in the pot another interpretation a player had was that when his antie went into the pot it was no longer his and the card could only be used to prevent one gold from a i raise card from being added from his supply and taken from the inn s which interpretation is correct or is neither of them correct question regarding red dragon inn

1,we inherited a fairly large retail space recently and are trying to get a business set up in it right now we re working on setting up a drink coffee shop now we re looking into board games not so much a retail outlet for board games but we ll probably try selling some stuff directly it seems like most people shop online and the markup probably isn t great but having people come and play games there could be good particularly since they might buy more drinks too could you give me some ideas and tips for what a good board game shop would have and how it might operate do people generally rent tables for time how do you keep the game pieces in good condition and intact do people rent games or bring their owns or both we have a pretty big open space for a seating area which is why board games seemed like a good option plus we have at least one private room we could use for something tips and suggestions for a local board game shop
1,hey everyone so i m sure that this was asked a few times in the past but with the age of covid and the like i figured i d ask again now that it s getting more open i wasn t huge on board games for the longest time mostly due to a lack of disposable income that s since changed thankfully and going to the last two gen cons plus just generally reading more into board games watching youtubers like susd has made me extremely invested in the games the issue now however is quite frankly finding a group my normal play group for nerdom and such is very much more on the card game side and that is the same issue with my lgs it s almost all predominantly magic players with very little actual board games i might just be missing some but i could use some advice having bought some games from gen con that i think i can at least teach my family but that doesn t really work for some of the more complex games that i really wanted to try and saw at the show so i guess the question is does anyone have any suggestions on finding people with similar interests with regards to board games are there any sorts of groups i should know about best way to find a boardgame group

1,played this a few weeks ago and was surprised how much i enjoyed it it s cooperative so it doesn t map fully to codenames but it s a word game and you have to make others guess which words on some cards are related to the four clues you provided what s really cool other than the neat mechanisms of four words per card one clue per word pair and the extra card from the deck to keep things interesting is that everyone is coming up with clues at the same time so nobody s waiting around for more than seconds or so plus since everyone s on the same team only one person has nothing to do at any one time until it s the next person s turn to have their clues associated to their cards so clover codenames without the downtime
1,i played a board game a while back and i can t remember the name the main mechanism of the game was that you had secret numbers facedown and could point at other players to guess their numbers you could also give other players a number card and they d have to put it in order with their secret numbers your secret numbers are in order lowest to highest the game also had secret identities and basically it was two teams fighting eachother but also your secret identity could change with cards that would like rotate all the secret identities clockwise around the table that s about it it was really fun it had anime style pictures and a lot of blank white backgrounds on the cards it had a name like secret agents or double agent or something remebering a secret identity board game
1,it doesn t seem like there s a consistent method that publishers use to announce another print run you d think they would want to be transparent about when their games would be available right i try the publisher s website bgg forums scrubbing their twitter page are there any other places to look i was specifically looking for info on fantasy realms it s in stock at cardhaus com but the shipping cost more than the game how do you know when a game will be printed again

1,hi everyone after doing a bit of research i have decided to get this war of mine for some depressing solo play but being a perfectionist i have also decided to get an expansion along with it my question is if this is necessary the base game itself seems like it s huge already if i were to get one though which of the two large expansions do you guys suggest tales from a ruined city or days of the siege i would like something focused more on solo play whilst using most or all of the components from all games complexity does not phase me so that is not a factor apologies if the questions aren t applicable to this type of game appreciate any insights this war of mine

1,i ve been playing board games for like years and i m always looking for solo games and i usually find that you have to manage more than one character and it usually feels better to manage only one also there are a lot of games that offer only a small adventure on repeat for example set a watch or proving grounds while they can be great i m looking for games that feel more like a video game where you manage your character and play a series of missions until you get to the ending meanwhile there s a story that unfolds there are a couple games that fit perfectly in this category that i know and that games are the th continent tainted grail and arkham horror the card game and marvel champions sure there are other games that almost fit this such as the lord of the rings journeys in middle earth and gloomhaven but both have to be played with two characters and i prefer using only one of them so to summarize i m looking for games that are playable solo with only one character have a narrative campaign that unfolds not just the same level over and over have a reasonably quick setup time minutes or less if possible bonus points if they are translated to spanish thank you and i hope more people can read this post to find games they like help me find games that have this features playable solo with one character have a story have a reasonably quick setup time minutes or less

1,hi this is my first post here i have spent hours upon hours reading previous posts reviews and watching yt videos seeing how helpful and chatty people in this community seem to be i decided to ask my question in a seperate thread i will keep it short i grew up in a casual bordgame household i randomly bought santorini at one point and absolutely loved it that s when i started going down the rabbit hole me and my current partner ended up playing santorini a bunch so i started looking for other games that were great for players but also played good at or even players i ended up with carcassone wonders duels splendor and sushi go carcassonne is for sure the favorite so far adding expansions made for great replayability wonders duel feels a little scripted to me and set up cleanup is almost longer than the actually playtime i am looking for something more complex and immersive but that won t frighten my partner family etc i am very close to getting everdell and have also spent a lot of time reading reviews comparing root and oath the consensus may seem to be that root is on the heavier side especially for learning and oath not playing that great at it looks like everdell has a lot of boardgame elements while for the main part being a worker placement game can anyone shared their opinions based on the little information about my experience criterias am i onto something with everdell are there other games i should look into memoir and twilight struggle are also games i have consideree recommendations for next game

1,i just finished my third play of the game overall very thematic fun and memorable like no other game however some parts of the game i don t really like for example dice rolling for combat ammo is already scarce and wasting it on a chance to damage an adult is not very good today dice rolling was awful almost aliens summoned and only one died i was thinking of rolling two dice and keeping the best result for ranged attacks has anyone tried that or another houserule for combat i feel like initial exploration is amazing but towards the end of the game you may feel it s impossible to go across the ship because there s a high chance of alien encounter in every room and they are too hard to kill goes back to the roll attack issue and can t run away from them without being attacked unless you found the right itemnemesis houserules

1,hey guys first time posting here i recently picked up nyctophobia the vampire version i couldn t find the initial version combat is weirdly worded it says that combat is initiated when a hunted finds the vampire when searching i saw in the base game rule book that it used to be initiated whenever they are directly adjacent to each other the big difference is that the expansion doesn t say if vampires could initiate combat with this new wording of the expansion what do you think is best i know it says play the way that is most fun but i don t know what that is overall though it is a pretty fun game nyctophobia

1,a few days ago there were posts about what would take over gloomhaven as the number spot there were many various responses with the most controversial one being gloomhaven isn t even the number boardgame instead it goes to d amp d but it s just not allowed on bgg i just have to say i somewhat agree with this idea but people presenting it had poop for brains language and presentation reasons i think this are social influence of d amp d is none like any other you talk to anyone on the streets and they ve heard of dungeons and dragons and there s a very good chance most have even played it even on top of that an even higher percentage would give a positive experience review of it to you the fucking money holy shit the amount of money spent on d amp d has got to be insane i don t actually have evidence to prove it but i m willing to bet my entire fortune that gdp on dungeons and dragons including accessories digital content and artwork is double the next competitor please someone prove me wrong this includes things like monopoly as well i m not necessarily saying this point by itself is the reason it s the best game i m just pointing to the fact that money talks dungeons and dragons sparked a deep influence of nerd boardgame culture when it was created in the s arguably more of an influence than star wars itself before dungeons and dragons yes there were dwarves elves and etc but d amp d fundamentally changed the mythical landscape of all future fantasy twofold an omnipotent game should have omnipotent potential this is what i believe the past reddit debaters were trying to present but did a shit job at and i have i say i agree d amp d is the closest game i have ever played to a trying unlimited potential of fun but i agree with other users who say that it also has an unlimited floor by having a bad dm the only game that could possibly take over gloomhaven would have to be a game that is d amp d but does a better job at achieving that unlimited potential not a game that is like gloomhaven but does it better to all the recent posts about gloomhaven lately i just wanna say my two cents

1,looking for a board game from the s the board was really a giant i foldable poster and i think it was a map of the world ish there were two rows of squares to follow around the outside of the map and each corner had a special square only they weren t square because the track you travelled wasn t square the two sets of cards were languages white cards with red writing and cards giving the capitals and maybe major cities from each country as well as the languages spoken there each continent had a themed colour i can t remember the the overall goal but i think it had something to do with matching countries capitals to their languages there may have been the word tower in the title or somewhere on the board i found a card while cleaning out my parents basement this summer but the vague memories i have of this game have haunted me for years hopefully someone knows what i m talking about board game with world map and language cards

1,i ve been really excited to try the loop after watching several reviews of it and was excited to see it on tabletopia so i fired it up and played my first solo game within two rounds dr faux had his first vortex and i had several other ages loaded with red cubes the cards and drops just weren t in my favor but hey not unheard of in a pandemic style game so i fired up another round double checked the rules to make sure i was playing it right and tried again this time the drops were kinder and the cards well that s where i struggled with this game i love the idea of the cards variable powers that you can build on by adding other cards but it just fell flat for me pulling cards that i just didn t need it was frustrating to be drawing cards to add energy cubes when i needed to be removing clones or rift cubes i had little to no control over what i pulled or who activated i felt like there the game needed some stock actions that everyone could do to mitigate bad draws use a green energy cube or discard a card to remove a rift cube or move a clone even when i got the cards i needed maneuvering around the board was laborious and the game just felt like it dragged on too long an hour into my second game and i had completed only of my goals and with more to go i called it quits i really want to like this game but maybe it s just not for me what do you think am i playing it wrong or did anyone else have a similar experience my experience with the loop

1,played an amazing board game at a friend s house who lives across country its a white box and kinda chinese japanese influenced its not the one with the panda its a board game where you travel and collect things and complete tasks last person goes first characters are chosen and the money is kinda coins with holes in them so is the card for the characters the point of the game is to make it to the end with the most pictures and foods completed because you stop at restaurants and cities and stuff each round ends when you stop at the city once your at a city you eat or not and then the trip across the board begins again i loved it what board game is it if it sounds familiar what s that board game

1,amp xb greetings fellow gamers a few months ago i had posted a picture of my made at home prototype for the game i ve been working on i was beyond flattered by the feedback and response i got from the community so from the bottom of my heart thank you i ve done everything for this project the art graphic design writing game design everything it s been a labor of love and i haven t regretted a single minute i ve spent working on it it s been an absolute blast having a vision and bringing it to life and i ve finally reached a point where i think i m ready to share this with the rest of the board game world it s a little nerve racking because it s been such a personal project up to this point and the only opinion i ve ever had to worry about was my own but i figured as long as it s something i know i love what s the harm in seeing if maybe someone out in the world might love it too so with that being said if it looks like something that peaks your interest let me give you a bit of a breakdown about this creation of mine amp xb for starters my game is called to hell and back it started as a creative outlet for myself that slowly evolved into a game i would be proud to share with others it s a solo push your luck adventure game with a player variant you ll be taking the role of a hero who has lost the love of their life and must venture through the depths of hell to bring them back to the land of the living it s inspired by stories of katabasis like orpheus and eurydice and dante s inferno i d like to say that this isn t a grandiose meaty game like mage knight or gloomhaven it s a game that focuses on crafting a story with a lighter game behind it that s not to say i ve eliminated depth the game has character progression changeable items equipment player choice and resource management all these elements have just been reduced down enough to create a large game feel in a bite size package it s also worth mentioning that it s not just a one and done adventure the events that unfold in this game are not set in stone each playthrough will provide a new experience from the enemies you face to the equipment you find and the events you overcome hell is brutal and you ll most likely find yourself meeting your own fate several times while trying to complete your goal that s why the game sets up and plays quickly so you can be excited to get back into it and try to emerge victorious i m still currently hard at work on this game playtesting designing drawing prototyping rinse repeat but until recently all the playtesting has mostly been done by myself and occasionally a few friends now that i ve decided to pursue this creation further i want to make playtesting more public so that i can gather as much input and feedback the dream would be to self publish this game and really see how far i can take it but i want to make sure i have a solid foundation before taking it to crowdfunding so if you re still with me first off thank you and secondly if this sounds like a game you d be interested in please consider subscribing to my email list at tohellandbackboardgame com and following me on instagram as that s currently the best way to see updates and reach me directly if you d like i love connecting with people and try my best to reply to every message i get the current goal is to take what i ve already created and break it down into a solid prototype i call the prologue box i want it to serve as the perfect way to get players interested in the gameplay and story to get there i know i need playtesters i plan on releasing prototypes through tts pnp and a few physical copies so that i can reach a vast majority of people i ll be reaching out to potential testers via the email list so i know i m getting opinions from the people that are truly invested in the vision if you are wary of providing an email that is completely understandable and if you still want to participate please just reach out to me via instagram or even here on reddit anyways sorry for the ramble i don t mean to come across as an advertisement i m just really excited i m not a huge company or an established designer i m just a board game lover like the rest of you and i m ready for this challenge finally ready to start sharing my game with the world

1,the non gamer grew up playing monopoly and thinks that s what all games are like refuses to play games that involve any kind of thinking but will still hang around and comment on how dumb or lame the game is will make an acception for fun games like cards against humanity the casual gamer will play games like ticket to ride catan code names and telestrations unaware of the underworld of gaming culture prime to be swayed to the dark side the light bulb gamer played a mid weight strategy game and had that moment where you see what games can really be has begun researching similar games and reading countless reviews of other games soon to have a modest collection of their own doesn t know what they ve gotten themselves into the goldilocks gamer has reached peaceful gaming bliss owns games but is not willing to go over that limit unless it s something truly special and will sell off games they re not playing to make room knows what they like but willing to try other games still has a regular gaming group or family who enjoys games the i might have a problem gamer has a collection well over games continues to buy even though games are still in the cellophane has at least kickstarters currently backed rates games low on bgg because they have a similar game they would choose over it still keeps both games gives opinions on games they ve never played thinking about starting a youtube review channel where do you fall the levels of board gamers
1,not sure if anyone is going to be able to point me in the right direction i really like the simplicity of the combat and the light bit of bluffing in yugioh just action points defence points and some action cards to add different drawing abilities i used to play the app and i m just wishing i had something like that to play in physical but not looking to get involved in a trading card game where i ve got to track down new cards to keep updated i d rather just buy a box that has everything necessary for a player game not a huge fan of fantasy themes either for what it s worth anyone have any ideas looking for a player lcg that plays like yugioh
1,i recently acquired this game used but it doesn t have the coyote marker i m curious if anyone either has some type of stl file of a suitable replacement or possibly is willing to part with theirs i ve been looking online for possible substitutes but nothing that s really grabbed my attention right now we just use a generic token to signify where is is but we enjoy it enough that i d like to find something better spirits of the wild

1,background i was contacted by portal dragon to be a playtester i do not know the designers personally have no affiliation with portal dragon and have no stake in the success of the game my experiences with the game have been through tts either solo or against my own friends colab by portal dragon of palm island fame is up on kickstarter i feel like it s been buried a bit because of gen con so i wanted to shine a little light on it and give my thoughts on both the multiplayer and solo experiences i ve played each twice i won t explain the rules here but it s basically a dice worker placement and engine building game where the placement spaces upgrade over time you can use other players workers and you generate resources that let you build a grid of cards that combo off of each other in interesting ways either for points more dice more resources etc components the campaign page doesn t show the entire game setup which is a little unfortunate there s the center board with modular lab spaces towers upgrades etc and each player gets a bowl with dice and a player mat and will be building a x grid of cards in front of them it takes up a decent amount of space and looks excellent the art is phenomenal especially on all of the cards the minions that hold the dice are player specific and look great and there are pretty chunky minis for each player it s really nice the base pledge is which feels totally reasonable for what you get i ve gotten much less attractive substantial games for much more on ks side note as an example of the art most reviews i ve seen love to show off h p lov kins but so far this is my personal favorite card multiplayer i ve played twice with players using tts s hot seat mode generally not a great way to play board games all of us thoroughly enjoyed it the strategic decisions are quite interesting especially when it comes to how you build out your grid when we get the physical game i m confident it will hit the table quite a few times the general positives and general negatives go into more detail about our experiences so i won t spend too long on it here solo i m used to tacked on solo modes so i was extremely pleasantly surprised by the solo mode your own turn plays almost exactly like the normal game but this is the entirety of the ai s turn take a token from a bag and do what it says seconds every few turns flip over a card and do what it says seconds and then you re right back to your own turn yet even with that being so simple the ai opponents that i tried felt threatening and were distinct in terms of how they affected me and what strategies were required to beat them oh and as a bonus you can play against multiple ai if you want or you can play multiplayer either cooperatively or competitively i believe against any number ai and there are achievements to unlock it s all just very well thought out i m kind of bummed that pretty much none of the reviewers have tried solo yet because it s so good general positives the absolute highlight of the game for me is the grid of cards you build you get a lot of cards as you go and they combo in such interesting ways that there s this constant pull to try to figure out how to work that new card into your strategy too one game for example i was building primarily machine cards i had at one point an ability that let me trigger a machine every time i took a collect action so i would trigger a card that triggers all of its adjacent cards one of which let me trigger all the cards on its row etc i would trigger cards off this one thing which would result in me getting permanent extra dice extra cards resource tokens etc it was nuts i was practically swimming in dice and could build a ton as a result super fun the irony is that i had focused too much on building this rube goldberg contraption of cards triggering other cards and while i was doing that another player was stockpiling points and ended up beating me by points the way the lab spaces upgrade over the course of the game is also really exciting again it s often abilities that trigger other abilities or that build up your resource engine so you just go faster and faster you get new dice new cards resource tokens etc but you can t always do everything on the lab because of where the minions are positioned so it s a fun puzzle a note on replayability most games tout having high replayability but what they really mean is you ll draw different cards and the board will be randomized so no two games will play out the same even though you re pretty much still using the same strategy colab on the other hand has a kind of replayability where different strategies are much more less feasible based on how the initial towers and upgrades are set up in one game for example it was really easy to get potion tokens so a potion heavy strategy ended up dominating but in another game they were tough to get and a monster based strategy ended up dominating you really have to be aware of what is going to be effective for the given game and it can drastically alter your strategy it creates a lot of room for creativity and clever plays general negatives perhaps this was worse because of the nature of tts hot seat but there s a bit of downtime between player turns especially since it can take a minute to figure out what you want to do with your minions i ve seen it mentioned in other reviews as well alex radcliffe from boardgameco particularly emphasized it so it s something to keep in mind see note below another issue is that i found it a little annoying to keep having to re tally which resources i had available to me but i m almost certain that s an issue that s primarily due to not being able to see the board or my player area during other people s turns again hot seat is awkward to use if i were playing the physical game i wouldn t have that handicap so it shouldn t be as big of an issue i haven t seen reviewers that have played physical copies complain about it which is really encouraging finally the game has two primary types of actions you can take on your turn collect and build i found that in my games the collect action got more attractive as you went because the labs kept getting upgraded but simultaneously the need to do it diminished as we played which felt a little odd it reminded me of century golem edition where people just kind of stop buying cards from the market as the game goes on see note below note i do happen to know that the designers are very aware of these two problems and are currently playtesting a rule tweak that simultaneously addresses both of them i know what the rule is and it sounds very promising in theory but it hasn t made it to my round of playtesting yet so i can t comment on how effective it is in practice final thoughts overall i m absolutely stoked for this game i ve backed a lot of games and am currently waiting on fulfillment for of them seriously crap i might have a kickstarter addiction but this is easily top in terms of how excited i am to get it in fact i m going to go play another solo game of it right now absolutely check it out if you re curious and even if you don t back it i d recommend saving it so you re reminded at the hr mark i believe but don t quote me on this that there are plans to open up the tts mod during the campaign so you ll be able to try it yourself so it s definitely worth keeping an eye on the campaign colab is up on kickstarter here s my review after plays

1,to me this is hard stop no exceptions i ve played both of these games a lot and i genuinely can t think of a reason people would prefer gloomhaven over a well thought out written dnd campaign i could possibly see new rpg players liking gloomhaven more due to it just being easier to rope play as there just isn t as much role play if at all if i were to express the level of fun out of for dnd and gloomhaven a bad game of dnd would be a whereas a good game would be meanwhile a bad game of gloomhaven would be and the absolute top would be maybe that s kinda how i visualize dnd just being a better game overall controversial opinion anyone who says gloomhaven is better than d amp d just has had a bad dungeon masters and or co players
1,for me i think it s pretty well accepted by every boardgamer i ve ever met to me it just feels weird the gloomhaven can be number when dnd isn t even in the same realm of that game which makes it sad that other games can t be ranked how universal knowledge is it that gloomhaven being ranked on bgg is symbolic for d amp d

1,unpopular opinion this really doesn t have anything to do with kickstarter not a huge fan of that platform but that is for another day before you start to comment please realize that i am very aware of the epidemic that we are facing i understand that shipping is skyhigh right now and if you want to comment about that feel free but yes i m aware why is the lack of communication so poor with so many projects and a lot of the time just dis honest are companies scared to tell the truth in fear that they will lose backers is their some limit on kick starter as too how many updates you can send i have been backing on kick starter for many years now i like to get games early which is no longer the case because many companies are selling before shipments and i like the deluxe upgrades that many offer deluxe upgrades is probably the only reason i back on kickstarter anymore i guess i m writing because i would like to know other peoples opinions about this are companies giving dates they know they can t complete games by to build excitement and try to get more backers to jump on board for extra funding are companies deliberately lying in updates and comments to make customers feel like they are doing everything they can on there project when they are really already working on a different one this is obviously just a rant and all comments are welcome but i am really getting frustrated with the way many of the projects are being ran now i feel kickstarter is just a pre order site for board games now kickstarter

1,i ve been following ks for a few years now and granted project will always slip by my radar but i can t remember a cmon game that wasn t instantly funded and reached some crazy amount by the end they have a formula of either look at our minis while we throw more minis at you usually combined with look at this ip you grew up with or at least a cool setting that seems to have provided them a well of infinite backers some of their more recent projects i didn t think would be as well received as they have been i e marvel united xmen united that cartoon pack with scooby doo etc so i say all this to propose a hypothetical what if scenario that would lead to cmon putting up a game that just fell flat the only thing i can think of is years down the line if they start scrapping the bottom of the barrel for ideas what s the likelihood that cmon can publish a game that doesn t reach funding

1,i played a game of dune imperium last night where we all were randomly given leaders we made sure two leaders from the same house couldn t be in play and i felt the advanced leaders had an edge with their abilities over the basic leaders in this game one player had an advanced leader duke leto and everyone else had basic leaders the way duke leto was able to move up the influence tracks just felt simply more powerful than the abilities of the basic abilities i was wondering if the game is only balanced to be played where everyone uses an advanced leader or everyone uses a basic leader but you don t mix the two not sure just felt strange feeling that one leader had their signet ring clearly help them gain victory points while another had their signet ring give them solari are the leaders in dune imperium balanced
1,i bought the eclipse e ks but only at the terran level which didn t include the various expansion items specifically the reference sheets turn order variant galactic events four additional hex tokens rift cannon minor species nine additional diplomacy tokens among other things now that those items are becoming available for purchase from lautapleit are any or all of them worth it they struck me as really expensive when i backed eclipse e but it s become one of my favorite games so i m trying to decide whether to play catch up on some or all of them i d be interested in what people think of each element since they re all now being sold separately another eclipse e question are the ks expansion items worth it
1,hello r boardgames i ll admit that i m not too sure about the rules permitting the description of board games on here but i recently stumbled upon this educational board game that i imagine could be used as a starting point for a discussion concerning a topic that some million people are afflicted with currently at any given time substance abuse the game is called downward spiral and it was created by the texas christian university s instittute of behavioural research there are two versions of the game an adult version and an adolescent version the two versions differ in the descriptions of events on the various cards that are drawn throughout the game overview in downward spiral each player takes the role of a person who is afflicted with substance abuse as each player makes their away along the game board s track the learn the consequences that substance abuse and have on a person s health and finances as well as family members and one s sense of self worth and personal accomplishments rules the objective of the game is to either be the last player standing when all of the other players have either succumbed to their drug abuse been locked away or have died or to successfully recover the game board looks like this insert picture of game board downward spiral an introduction to the game you really don t want to play

1,amp xb amp xb i haven t slept the past two days due to sheer excitement i wanted to produce my own board game for a very long time but never got around creating anything more than half baked paper prototypes which then lacked the final spark to turn into real products until i found my partner who is a fantastic art director in her own right and exactly the person i was missing in my life in all the ways i told her about my idea and she immediately went this sounds like a fun project a month of basic game design a month of looking at production costs and writing emails to companies all over the globe several weeks of finding an artist to convey the style we were looking for and then finding someone else entirely who simply blew us away and several months of playtesting and balancing later i finally pushed the button our kickstarter pre launch site is now live amp xb duelists is a fast paced two player game where your goal is to outmaneuver and out bluff your opponents you pick a character with their own unique deck and actions and plan cards leveraging your character s strengths and weaknesses while also trying to anticipate your opponents plans the rules will of course be provided in full when the campaign launches as will the free tabletop simulator version so you can have a look at how the game works before spending money on it as we re a tiny two person team i would like to appeal to you if you like the looks of the game please share it and sign up to be notified getting ready for the duelists kickstarter

1,these mods can be taken together or separated but tend to work best when combined also a question about the game do you discuss what you d like to be done with the climate marker during food cards or do you all play silently and sort of allow the fates to decide climate trends this causes the climate marker to move slower requiring shifts of the current clime for it to matter but can also cause jumps creating urgency and surprise motions that can drastically alter the ecosystems in play whichever direction the climate marker last moved should be faceup on the board for this mod reveal cards as normal if the climate marker would be moved towards the side that is currently faceup it moves one additional space ignoring events that it passes over accelerating the trend if the climate marker would move against the side that is currently faceup it is turned sideways and stays where it is stalling the trend if the climate marker is currently sideways and would be moved either direction it moves one space as normal beginning a trend a neutral result while the climate marker is face up causes it to move the faceup direction trending a neutral result while the climate marker is sideways causes it to stay where it is stable trend ex last turn the climate marker moved towards the hot side of the board and is placed with the sun side faceup in the zone where it landed after counting food cards this turn there is a majority of snowflakes so the climate marker is turned on its side and the zone does not change ex last turn the climate marker was turned on it s side this turn after counting food cards there is a majority of suns the climate marker is then placed with its sun side faceup and moved one space towards the hot side of the board ex the climate marker has it s sun side faceup after counting food cards there is a sun majority the climate marker is then moved two spaces towards the hot side of the board it passes over a desertification event but does not land on it so it is ignored amp xb unstable climate similar to how placing food works if we get the difference between suns and snowflakes we can move the marker this way as well everything is normal for this except that we treat the climate marker the same as the watering hole ignore events that the climate marker passes over only play them if it lands in that zone note if combining unstable climate and climate trends ignore rule from above the movement generated by the differences will cause enough instability we don t need to add more ex when food cards are revealed we end up with a total of suns and snowflakes this gives us a difference of snowflakes so the climate marker moves spaces towards the cold side of the board ex trends unstable last turn the climate marker moved towards the hot side of the board so is sun side up after food cards are counted this turn there is a difference of snowflakes it takes one to turn the climate marker sideways and stall it s trend then it moves the remaining three spaces towards the cold side of the board amp xb you can play both of these with the spicy trends variant where you do not ignore passed over events it gets pretty rough sometimes though as you end up triggering many events in a single game amp xb i ve seen climate catch some flak because it can be a little random and either end up being a total non factor or kinda run everybody into the ground i think with some added control elements it could be a fun little mechanic that adds a lot of value to an already very good game i am curious to know what you all think play variant evolution climate

1,i don t play board games myself but it s really striking whenever i hear drama arise from the board gaming community and find that people typically take the exact opposite stance from what you d expect from moba players mmo players fps players etc the only thing i can guess is that a lot of board game players were pushed out by the video game community because it s overwhelmingly not progressive and took refuge elsewhere rather than it being something that developed convergently is there any research into this why is the board gaming community significantly more socially progressive than the gaming community at large

1,this is a bit odd and may seem off putting to some so please bear with me here and know that my intention is not to offend any that have differing beliefs your beliefs are valid even if we may disagree i d like some advice on a board game and i realize this may seem absurd to some my wife and i just picked up the base game for arkham horror the card game we haven t opened it yet but i have a bit of a concern with the subject matter which i am largely unfamiliar with we are christian and our particular beliefs leaves us strongly inclined to avoid anything involving or based in actual spiritualism witchcraft demonism etc does the lovecraft universe ground itself in any kind of real world satanic themes i know this is a bit odd as many of the monsters cults and such may have generic affiliations with occultism ie necromancy witches and spells but does it actually involve satanic rituals and such in the game or is it all based on fictional cosmic horrors monsters and otherworldly beings more strictly based in lovercrafts literary works this may seem overly sensitive or require some elaboration for those that don t hold my particular beliefs chime in and let me know if you think this game would be better off passed on to someone else who might appreciate it more i d rather not get invested in a story to inevitably be put off by it or feel that it crosses my beliefs enough that i have to quit part way through no spoilers please keep references as generic as possible arkham horror lovecraft games and satanism question

1,in my brother was suffered a serious concussion playing football for the rest of that decade he would suffer from a myriad of various health problems brought on by tat injury preventing him from going to college and until recently get a job we went from doctor to doctor trying to find a way to help him recover from the seemingly permanent damage the injury caused but with little success it was a difficult time for our family but one thing my brother had his heart set on was making a board game often unable to leave the house or even move about the house he was still often able to play board games the game he wanted to design was very specific a v only game involving limited communication tactical planning a team based asymmetric rock paper scissors game with some prisoner s dilemma and false nash equilibrium thrown in for good measure the kinda game impossible to pitch to publishers despite it eventually having dragons which meant he had to make the game himself turns out there s a lot that goes into making a game even after years of play testing and rule tweaking there s finding artists graphic designers printers marketing and all while he still struggled with his injuries and eventually also getting a different job sometimes i like to take partial credit for the game calling myself a co designer director of marketing or lord high executioner but really this is my brother s whole creation from concept to design to now finally publication it s a small game easy to miss on a shelf but the number of different ideas he came up with before settling on this design is a bit mind boggling so it makes me wonder how much work must have gone into other games and how much we might take that for granted this game may not mean a lot in the grand scheme of things i think it s fun but i m biased but this game means at lot to my brother to finally achieve this dream despite all the struggles setbacks and circumstances that made creating this game so hard i m not posting a link to this game here i didn t want this to be just a self promotion post i really just wanted to talk about how hard it can be to make a game and celebrate the fact my brother finally did it despite everything if you want to know more it s called dragon and riderafter ten years we finally made our board game

1,i was thinking of buying this game because i ve read great things about it but one thing that stops me from considering it is because i don t see many youtube videos about it as compared to most board games is it because the game is old now and most people don t play it anymore is it considered a dead game i might be wrong but i dont think there s continuous editions to keep it fresh is it a board game that is mainly just popular in the us and not much outside of the us i live in the uk just wanted some more depth regarding the game if its still relevant today and that people still play it cosmic encounter
1,it s well known that the streets of monopoly are named after the streets of atlantic city new jersey where the game was adapted from the landlord s game however we all know that the economy and property values is something that changes with time so what follows is a proof of concept for modern monopoly an attempt at bringing this game into the st century please note that due to the monopoly currency symbol not being available in unicode i will be using dollars for this this is also a work in progress feedback would be appreciated the main difference is that the board has been updated to reflect the current values of real estate in atlantic city the following changes have been made since st charles place is gone it has been replaced by maryland avenue illinois avenue was renamed marin luther king jr boulevard in the s on the modern monopoly gameboard this is rendered as mlk jr boulevard marvin gardens is now rendered as marven gardens the correct spelling park place has been replaced with florida avenue as no pricings could be found for the former the purchase prices have been recalculated to reflect modern values the recalculations have meant the properties have had to be rearranged the property purchase values are from least to most valuable the railroads all cost and the ulities are both the costs of houses and hotels are multiplied by compared to the original game the rules themselves are mostly the same as in standard monopoly with these differences to account for the new property values each player is given million upon game start the bills are in units of thousands of dollars instead of individual dollars the chance and community chest cards are mostly the same however have been updated to reflect the new values of the money and properties and several old ones have been added back into the deck a few of them have been reworked completely they now appear as follows chance community chest advance to marven gardens advance to go and collect advance to go and collect the irs made an error calculating your taxes and owes you advance to mlk jr boulevard if you pass go collect doctor s fee pay advance to kentucky avenue if you pass go collect from selling a stock you collect advance to the nearest railroad and pay the owner twice the rent to which they are otherwise entitled if the railroad is unowned you may buy it form the bank get out of jail free this card may be kept until needed or sold advance to the nearest utility and pay the owner rent equal to x the dice roll if the utility is unowned you may buy it form the bank go to jail go directly to jail do not pass go do not collect bank pays you dividend of holiday fund matures collect get out of jail free this card may be kept until needed or sold income tax refund collecy go back three spaces it is your birthday collect form every player go to jail go directly to jail do not pass go do not collect life insurance matures collect make general repairs on all your properties for each house pay for each hotel pay hospital fees pay you lose a lawsuit select one other player and pay them school fees pay take a trip on the reading railroad and collect as you pass go receive a consultancy fee you have been elected chairman of the board pay each player you are assessed for street repairs pay per house and per hotel your building loan matures collect you inherit a family fortune worth grand museum opening colelct from every player pay school tax of go back to vertnor avenue go directy to income tax do not pass go do not collect you win a small lottery collect pay a fine or take a chance card that s all i have for now this is a work in progress feedback would be appreciated modern monopoly a proof of concept

1,i finally got this on the table with other players total and i must say i really like the game now having actions every turn only once did we all choose the same action really accelerated the game and finally got to see a bunch of combos working for myself and other players it s definitely not as complex as terraforming mars the board game but it s more accessible to casual gamers my two friends who played it with me loved it and both are going to buy the game soon the score in the end was pretty close too to to fun times amp xb mars ares expedition quick player update
1,greetings considering i already own wonders for the draft terraforming mars for the ressource and engine building and res arcana it it worth owning it s a wonderful world i have an obsession with not having games too similar and now is it a good alternative to wonders i absolutely love this game but tbh i own it out of principle like i can t have a board game collection without that one but i don t play it with my friends only with my family and they already have one courtesy of yours truly so i consider giving it to my college brother and replace it with it s a wonderful world any advice thanks a lot it s a wonderful world
1,in my group i m the one who buys the most games which means i m the one who does most of the teaching i like to think i m pretty decent at it but sometimes a game is just difficult to teach even if it has a simple rule set two in particular come to mind sabotage this is a v hidden movement action programming game every round someone rolls a set of dice and everyone alters their dice to match use the dice rolled to program your action tiles or upgrade your character then perform the actions in order good guys win if they hack the doomsday weapons enough times bad guys win if they kill the good guys enough times that is literally the whole teach despite that it can take a really long time to teach min plus because everyone needs to know exactly how all the actions function before they can make intelligent plans this is even more important because of the hidden aspect of the game you can t be asking rules questions mid game i love it but teaching it is really hard work hansa teutonica it s a very basic very dry euro you get some number of actions on your turn you can use actions to get cubes place cubes re place cubes move cubes or score a route sometimes when you score a route people get points other times you get to upgrade something like number of actions or how many cubes you can get game goes until someone gets points or we score enough routes that s the whole thing super simple super elegant loads of depth from a very limited set of choices but teaching it is painful because in isolation none of the rules have meaningful thematic connection to make them easy to grok every rule you explain just comes across sounding random and unrelated to everything else three turns into playing everyone suddenly gets it and has a great time before that everyone is looking at you like you re explaining cones of dunshire what games have simple rules but are still difficult to teach
1,i backed my first ks campaigns nemesis lockdown and massive darkness and have since moved states usa i submitted a change of address for both campaigns but neither seemed to provide a firm confirmation that their system would correct it in time for shipping surely this is common given that especially with recent shipping and materials delays a ks project can take years to ship have other people had experience in changing their address after the conclusion of the campaign specific feedback from regarding awaken realms or cmon would be a bonus how do kickstarter campaigns account for moving addresses
1,i ve played this probably times over the last few days and really love the game i do have a couple of ideas for variants however based on things that i ve seen i have a total team conversion a modification to the research action and a couple other small ideas i d love to hear your input amp xb research partners a player team variant for the sector board this could be played on the side and the theory rules would just change to only being allowed to share piece of information submit paper total we played a couple player games and i felt they left a little to be desired in terms of turn frequency after making a target or narrow survey and that published theories were just too rapid and spread out to make for a very interesting experience i think that adding a v or v if you wanna get real spicy variant could add a lot of aha moments between players as well as add some weight to their decisions teams players team up with a player adjacent to them before determining starting information choose either the player on your left or right to form your teams for the rest of the game you two are considered a team for the purposes of all rules regarding teams theory phase and will not be used during this game for the purposes of the theory phase you will only be publishing through sectors and during the theory phase teams decide to either publish or share share declare as a team that you are going to share this phase among your team decide who will share first that player chooses an action they have taken and informs their teammate of its result the second player on the team now chooses an action and shares that information back lt mark these on your sheet so you know which you ve already shared gt do not discuss or reveal any more information and do not show your maps ex during the theory phase in sector team a decides to share rather than publish player a chooses a survey that they found particularly helpful and tells their teammate a now knowing the information from that survey shares a research topic that relates note listening to what your teammate is doing on their turn will be imperative to having useful information to share but you cannot coordinate your moves via open discussion pay attention to what your research partner is doing publish declare as a team that you are going to publish this phase when publishing each team member may publish one paper choose this secretly just as in the base game when everyone at the table is ready place these just as you would in the base game teams can publish on the same sector just like players normally can this is called group research while players must still follow the placement rules from the main game group research does apply to tokens added in later theory phases as long as it s still the same sector if peer review reveals that a team with group research has gotten both tokens correct that team receives one additional point do not double your points for group research if peer review reveals that a token was incorrect both pieces for that team move forward one space so two spaces if both tokens were incorrect whether placed in the same or different sectors this penalty has nothing to do with group research ex team a chooses to publish during the theory phase in sector once both members have chosen their tokens and confirmed that team b is ready b has decided to share both members of team a place tokens a has chosen sector and a has chosen sector in a later phase team b and a also place tokens in sector in the next peer review it shows that team a was correct on their assumption that sector held a gas cloud and sector an asteroid it also reveals that team b placed a gas cloud and a dwarf planet in sector only netting them one correct result team a scores nine points for their now published theories pts for the cloud pts for leader lt cloud and asteroid gt pt for group research lt cloud gt pts for the asteroid while team b scores four pts for the cloud but must also move both of their pawns forward one space for incorrectly guessing the dwarf planet note revealing the same object in different sectors does not constitute group research the extra point from group research is only granted if both tokens are in the same sector finding planet x only one player per team can find planet x the trailing player of a team can still publish papers as normal but only member as above both pawns move when a team searches for x whether they find it or not uneven variant if you want to play v the lone player starts with pieces of information whereas the team starts with a piece the lone player plays according to the normal rules of the game maybe remove group research in this version amp xb amp xb hypotheses a mod with a focus on more limited knowledge and weightier choices can be played with either or sectors but was conceptualized for in all of our slice games where i haven t found x i ve still walked away with points and either won or given the x player a real run for their money and i m not super into that i m all for alternate ways to win but it feels like x doesn t hold quite enough weight if i can just spam theories as i know information anyway lt i also just don t like the research then max band survey tactic as i think it really slows the game down gt so to amend that research action the research action can only be taken during a theory phase not as a regular turn action theory phase during the theory phase players will either submit a theory or research players may only submit one theory phase even in an sector game if a player chooses to research they do so as normal and choose one topic from the list amp xb amp xb modified theory points what if being last to submit a theory actually mattered the scaffolding for this is already in place st spot in a sector gets nd get s so why doesn t rd get the game is already there and from a thematic standpoint it makes sense as well old news is well old news peer review the first slot in a sector gives point to any paper there the second slot gives the third slot gives papers do not move once a sector has been correctly peer reviewed ex players a and b submit a theory in sector during the first available phase and the two theories move up to the first slot on the track in the second phase no one submits anything new to that sector in the third available phase player c submits a paper and the sector is peer reviewed this reveals that all players assumed correctly that there was an asteroid in the space players a and b get pts pts asteroid pt first slot while player c only gets pt pts asteroid pt third slot this could have an addition that cancels the leader bonus when simultaneous theories are submitted making even the first spot if more than one player enters a theory there play variants the search for planet x

1,hiya guys so the new dune movie is in cinemas now im going saturday hype i decided to show some interest in the boardgame i noticed the rating is quite good iirc so i ve learned that the game is a mix of a deck builder and a worker placement now hang on a sec i heard this before in a game released recently lost ruins of arnak i own arnak i like it alot but my fear is will dune be different enough to buy it it also looks like terraforming mars a bit where as the player you start with in dune feels the same as the corperation in tfm you get some bonus perks etc passive bonusses so it feels like a baby between tfm and lost ruins of arnak with the bonus of adding some combat in the game that does sound like a game for me but again with having tfm and arnak will dune be a good buy or will it be more of the same i already have last question how is the solo mode for you guys in dune and players thanks in advance odyso about dune imperium vs other games

1,recent conversations got me thinking about how bad art affects or more interestingly does not affect reception of a game ethnos and terraforming mars are both great games however the community consensus seems to be that ethnos bad art is its defining feature and it isn t even bad just ho hum or dull while terraforming mars bad art which is genuinely almost cynical cash grab poor is treated like a charming quirk why the difference why does bad art hurt some games but not others

1,finally opened my terraforming mars ares expedition card game over the weekend and played the solo mode to learn the game i m pleasantly surprised that this game satisfies the exact reason i bought it for which was a faster simpler version of terraforming mars board game without as many fiddly bits the game was easy to learn especially if you already know how to play terraforming mars and plays solo mode in under an hour the solo mode is actually pretty hard as i wasn t even close to completing all the objectives the first time but the nd play i barely made it on the last turn with nothing to spare the mechanics draw from race for the galaxy where players play one of action cards and then reveal and everyone gets to do only the actions played by everyone the person who plays it gets an extra bonus i still need to try this with more than just myself but i m glad this game fulfills my expectations anyone else have similar experiences going from the board game to this card game version terraforming mars ares expedition solo mode is fun

1,this is a board game pet peeve of mine games that use dry erase markers and thick cardboards drive me nuts first of all the dry erase markers die quick even if you don t overuse them if you don t play a game for a couple weeks the markers are probably going to dry out and then the reusable cardboard used in the games sometimes holds onto the ink resulting in permanent stains making the scorecard or play mat or whatever the card stock is used for in the game unusable is it just me or does anyone share my frustrations anyone else dislike games that use white board card stock and dry erase markers

1,just kind of curious how people feel about the prices they pay for their board games supplies my flgs has everything in their store for msrp except on tuesdays they do off obviously i try to support them as a local business but at what point do you draw the line just a hypothetical like an game or you could buy online for or less i will say i used to buy the cheapest price i could find which usually led to amazon but since following more places like r boardgamedeals on reddit and seeing local businesses struggle during the pandemic i now typically buy locally gamenerdz or mm first amazon is my last resort and usually if they re the only ones who have it in stock also i would buy local in a heartbeat if the prices were comparable but it s hard to pay so much more for the same thing any thoughts if you have been in this dilemma too do you still buy from your flgs if all of their prices are msrp

1,mini rant incoming i know there was some controversy with regards to the barrage kickstarter especially with the quality of the water droplets however i m not sure what the quality of the components were for the kickstsrter version overall but i really hope they were better than the retail version i was lucky enough to pick up barrage on sale recently for been on my wishlist for ages and normally sits well north of in the premium euro category alongside games like scythe a feast for odin spirit island obsession glen more ii etc i can t get over how cheaply everything is made the main board doesn t have rounded edges and is already peeling away even the castles of burgandy board had this you can see remnants of where every single piece of cardboard has been punched out even on the dual player board spaces it s really distracting the wheel that doesn t even fit snugly in its slot they couldn t be bothered to have a plastic spindle the art is way darker than the artist probably intended the insanely cheap cardboard stock the way everything was just thrown loosely into a box that was too big without an attempt at a basic cardboard insert what the hell yes it has dual player boards yes it has wooden pieces but you can tell this was at the designers request and cranio have tried to cut corners as much as possible in the production i bet they tried to convince luciani to make the retail version pieces cardboard instead of wooden prior to this the game i owned with the worst component quality was newton manufactured by you guessed it cranio creations possibly the thinnest card stock i ve ever come across they should be embarrassed that they charge retail for this currently i would seriously urge any board game developer to go to another manufacturer you will get a far better representation of your product and something you can be proud of i thought lookout games were bad but at least their games are priced accordingly cranio need to get with the times take a look around and see what other board game publishers are producing for the same cost it s no longer acceptable to cut corners and rush production on this level then expect the same price as on mars edit i do like the barrage embossed box art though ha cranio creations unacceptable component quality barrage newton maharaja etc
1,picked up king s dilemma a week ago and i m reading the rules right now to prepare for our first game the rulebook is really great and detailed but there is one thing i can t figure out i understand that the king dies when you are on the last spot on the time counter and the dilemma card had the little skull icon on it or you draw dilemma cards in the last spot of the time counter my question is is it possible to draw a dilemma card with the skull icon before reaching the end of the time counter if you do draw the dillema card with the skull icon before the end of the time counter does the king die king s dilemma king s death

1,i asked a similar question over at r tabletopdesign r boardgamedesign and wanted to get a different perspective on the question i ve been spending time re evaluating the graphic design layout for my game i m designing which has lead me down quite the rabbit hole prior i assumed due to popularity evergreen tcgs like pokemon and mtg surely must have the best format but when you look at cards not counting the much earlier cards and their walls of text like huntmaster of the fells or more recently tibalt s trickery i wouldn t exactly call them the gold standard pokemon is also a different beast with the full art promos prioritizing the card art assuming their player base will know the card well enough to not have to squint to read it s effects i personally really like the way thunderstone quest handled their heroes leveling up giving the card a slightly larger text box with each iteration i like the iconography of the card game lightseekers but i think the art box really limits the visual elements of the card i also wasn t a huge fan of how their keywords had those little black boxes around them although i do admit it really helps it stand out whether it s the iconography the fonts or maybe the card just speaks to you what are some of your favorite card layouts what is your favorite card design layout

1,when second editions of games come out we often see just the changing of a number or mild tweak wonders modified a resource cost or two among other things eclipse moved the cost of a tech by here and there agrciola cards added gain x immediately or reduced a number san juan increased the prefecture from to through the ages changed a science cost or two this makes me think about digital games having an offline game option to modify stuff like the digital version of eclipse st edition could probably easily be relevant with just a few number tweaks terraforming mars could be interesting if you could make a custom playlist of cards or play around with their costs remember when you beat goldeneye on n and it had those sliders to play around with stat sliders that was a blast are there any digital games that let you customize gameplay in such a manner the closest i seen is through the ages that has challenges that plays with numbers on cards and the xbox live arcade version of catan let you do vp or vp instead of and the live arcade version of carcassone let you choose between old scoring and new scoring i liked that are there any digital board ganes that let you play around with variables
1,i have a group who have become interestedcan somebody tell me where to get a cheap copy of campaign for north africa
1,i found out about this game on reddit it s coming soon to kickstarter and i think it looks very promising the premise is pretty original just like i like them you have to choose some magic creatures and get them to the tavern in time to show that you have the most friends i think it ll be very fun to see the board filled with creatures that interact with one another there s a ton of room for strategy and replayability and the artwork looks really good this isn t paid promotion by any means i just wanted to give a shoutout to these people because it s an promising upcoming indie game and i know how hard it is to generate a big hype they have a website and a kickstarter pre launch page you heard about magical friends and how to summon them
1,in our early plays my buddy made the following observation how would you respond im too new to know assuming two characters have the same move value if one character is ahead can t they start running away they get to move say spaces and draw cards the other character can do the same but if this continues forever the chasing player will exhaust to death first so the chasing player will have to start boosting which is functionally card disadvantage this means that the leader will have more options in hand when the chaser does attack so yeah what do you think of this observation early play strategy question about unmatched
1,hello i have a friend that has been having a hard time in his life he is a vietnamese foreign exchange student and was previously majoring in computer science his family spent a lot of money to send him to school in the states then he developed a problem with his eyes that prevents him from using a computer for more than minutes that has ruined his life and sent him back to square one i have been trying to think of something i could do to lift his spirits i m not good with this sort of thing but he once expressed frustration that i didn t have any board games with vietnam i don t know how serious he was since i really only have two or three games that have real life countries but i figure i could put together a care package for him with a board game featuring vietnam presumably he wouldn t want a board game featuring the vietnam war are there any board games that star vietnam but don t involve the vietnam war if you would like to give me any input on the situation in general i will listen board game featuring vietnam no vietnam war
1,how long have you been involved in the hobby i played lots of risk in high school and a bit of blokus right after college but i didn t start buying and playing hobby designer games until the beginning of my collection what would you change about your collection if you could kickstarter is still my biggest regret none of the games i love have come from kickstarter gùgōng and prêt à porter are pretty good but i could have purchased them retail for much cheaper i ve sold just about everything else that i backed i tried selling the th continent at a local convention but nobody wanted it favorite games i own my answer was exactly the same two years ago great western trail concordia and race for the galaxy the resistance hanabi and agricola are also pretty high up there for me newest games raxxon and inis i picked up raxxon for at a local con if i don t like it i ll just give it away i should be receiving inis in the next week or two very much looking forward to trying that one out most and least played including asynchronous digital plays with friends i ve played both star realms and race for the galaxy about times each still haven t gotten tired of them when it comes to physical plays i m up to plays of marvel legendary it s one of the only games my wife requests we re not huge marvel fans but it s a nice breezy co op full of fun combos despite having it in my collection for a few months now i still haven t played barrage hoping i can get it played before the end of the year games that might be leaving my collection soon i wouldn t mind getting rid of small world king of tokyo or the th continent anyone interested in buying or trading feel free to make recommendations or ask questions if you d like to see my post from two years ago click here nearly five years in
1,hello boardgamers i finally decided to take a step from digital gaming and join into the world of board games i have not played board games since i was a kid and i ve been playing video games my whole like i m years old and i have played video games since i was now i wanted to try something different and i am excited to spend time with these games already played a lot of welcome to and it s a really fun game to play i mostly bought games that i can play solo since i don t have many friends who are into board games and lots of hassle trying to fit schedules so in the picture you can see my first ever boardgames i ve gotten since my childhood i actually received mage knight ue just this morning looks awesome there are lots of new things to learn from these games fall is here and evenings and days are getting darker so what better thing to do than spending time with some quality board games i hope i can grow my collection in the future but first i need to learn to play these first step from digital games to board games
1,hi a group of three friends who finished gloomhaven looking for something similar to proceed to theme does not matter it does not have to be a dungeon crawler it can what s important are the mechanics of character development skills items exp etc decisions making as a group and continous story what games fit these description also which of this games do or do not fit aeon s end stuffed fables lotr mage knight thank you what s after gloomhaven
1,do any of you guys have those hexagonal gaming tiles from wyrmwood if so do you mind letting me know which tiles you have what you use them for what game what components and if you think they are good for that use i am drooling over these tiles and thinking about picking up some of the tiles in their kickstarter however i want to get actual tiles that i will use and i am having a hard time envisioning how some these tiles besides maybe the solo tile would actually fit in normal play unless you had like multiple card combo tiles for every player like don t people usually have too many cards in their hand for like terraforming mars of wingspan to use one card tile combo tile i am too poor to get multiple tiles for each person lol but getting a set of solo tiles seems kind of boring hahaha thank you here is the link if people are interested kickstarter hexy tiles
1,i liked everything about the video game the setting the lore gameplay etc the board game really interests but its a bit expensive i saw some reviews and gameplay of it seems it seems good combat looks great because its strategic not dice rolling and i love games that needs some thinking is it worth buying the game tho should i buy bloodborne the board game
1,there s been a lot of discussions of favorite games in terms of aesthetics but i m curious if anyone has examples of games that are beautiful to look at but hard to enjoy like an over detailed map that makes it hard to see chits and tokens color themes that you can t distinguish from each other super detailed icons that are too small to appreciate etc etc basically is it possible for a game to be too beautiful what game has such beautiful art that it ruins the game by cluttering it
1,for many years going there has been on my to do list this year i finally have the opportunity to do so as i ll be in europe for most of the year starting from late september and my time is flexible but i got thinking do i really want to in the past when i was a teenager i ve been to a number of game cons in the us gencon and such and few smaller ones here and there i love board games but as i get older now hitting s and in the covid era i am not sure if i find the idea of a gigantic crowded area appealing i did enjoy my times and gencon and like but i also remember aimless wondering and looking for an open place to play games it was fun with friends but now i am thinking it will be just me and my wife who likes board games but is not a die hard fan we don t know anyone else who will be there and i never cared that much for the next hot game so seeing it first and even grabbing a few promos is again not something that i dream about anymore nor are we dedicated to a particular game so we won t be entering any championship and just watching others play is not appealing either so as i am looking at planning the trip i find my entire motivation waning and i am thinking what will we get at essen that we won t get from playing a game with few friends at home yes it s the experience but what exactly is the spiel experience and is it worth k bucks travel accommodation and covid era risks help me out tell me what you loved about essen or why it was disappointing and are you going this year do you want to go there again why or why not should i go to essen spiel
1,does the spirit special power continue after all of your race tokens have been conquered eg my tritons were in decline when i selected spirit orcs if all of the orcs are eliminated do the tritons remain in decline i would argue no because there are no orcs to be in decline and they cannot use their special power if they aren t on the board and also because they weren t mine smallworld spirit special power after elimination

1,not sure if this is the right place for this question sorry if it s not i m recreating the board game dodge or dare from the show the amazing world of gumball it s a simple game where you roll the dice and take a dare card which is a difficult or ridiculous task if you do the dare you move forward that many spaces or you can take a dodge card which is like a dare but nicer to you instead and move half as many in the show the game is extremely chaotic because has magical properties that create absurd situations for the characters i was hoping to capture a similar energy in the actual game to the one in the show but i m stuck on what the cards should be are there any similar games i could look at for inspiration or any existing game challenges that could work as dodges or dares making dodge or dare from the amazing world of gumball but realistically playable
1,so my covid pod just played game today and somehow found ourselves without any goals we made it to the part where the traitor is revealed and then nothing other than the traitor kills all players as a goal there was no players must do x you couldn t kill the thrall and there were no more instructions what in the heck happened we called it a wash and said the house killed us but what a disappointment after months of playing amp xb any insight betrayal legacy where did we go wrong possible spoilers
1,i ve recently learned about battlecon and have enjoyed playing it however it doesn t have any card draw mechanics which is something i really do enjoy about most ccgs i ve tried looking into lcgs and similarly categorized games but a lot of them seem to involve deckbuilding i m trying to find something that basically only runs on premade decks of cards a lot of people i try to play board games with are very casual and it would be nice if we could just open up a box pick a deck and start playing any suggestions are there any games that are like mtg without any deckbuilding constructing

1,a closer look at boggle also known as the game i lost points to i am a man known for my hubris i seldom lack confidence regardless of the degree to which this confidence is deserved and i have made peace with the fact that it is basically a coin flip that determines whether or not it is this luckily helps translate to boardgames too where i am able to sit down for most games with the confidence that i will win but with the knowledge that it s a coin flip if i will there are only two games really in which this is not the case or rather there are two scenarios in which this is not the case chess with basically anyone and boggle with my girlfriend boggle for those unaware is a game played with sixteen dice with letters on them you shake them in a kind of shaker such that they randomly fall onto a x grid and you then get three minutes to find as many words in the grid as you can you can kind of go criss cross applesauce across the grid so long as the letters are connected either orthogonally or diagonally and so long as you don t use the same die face more than once per word after the three minutes are up you check the words that everyone has if players have the same word they don t score that word meaning you only score points for words that only you have found and you score more points for longer words it sounds easy enough and a game that i sat down to play with the absolute biggest bag o hubris that i can remember i have a masters degree in english how hard could it possibly be for me to win this silly word game is what i thought to myself before i lost points to after playing two rounds what took me a while to figure out is that boggle is not actually a word game not really boggle is a pattern recognition game the key to winning boggle is the ability to quickly recognize the patterns in which words are likely to appear key vowels for example or specific consonant clusters and then find any and every way in which those patterns present themselves my partner is quite good at it legendarily so and it is fascinating to reverse engineer how she found specific words on the grid that i was only able to stare at she always ends up with these gordian knot style snakes across the board for absolutely bonkers words though she does tend to go for volume more than length a second key strategy for boggle is to recognize when there are words embedded inside other words the word smiles for example also has smile mile and miles inside it there s words that you can spell by reading parts of words in reverse for example or by taking diagonal steps at certain words and being able to recognize those patterns quickly is where the real game is it s the same principle that makes it so that scrabble is actually an area control game rather than just a word game in scrabble you score points by playing valuable tiles onto valuable squares in boggle you win by finding rich word veins and mining them for all they re worth it isn t the eloquence or obscurity of the words you find play that scores the words don t score anything for their inherent quality other than the fact they exist they are the tool you use to score with in the same way that a six of hearts in poker doesn t inherently score you anything it is the context that scores not the piece inherently so what does that say about boggle then if anything at all it means that i would not recommend it as a pure word game to people as that s not really what it is about though haveing a large vocabulary certainly does help it s a game of real time high speed pattern recognition rather than any type of thoughtful dictionary skirmish it s competitive rorschach testing moreso than a spelling bee it s a dexterity game where the skill being tested is your eyesight and that part of your brain that knowns that barley also has bar and ley inside it no i could not come up with a better example that s probably why i lost to a closer look at boggle also known as the game i lost points to
1,hi i m looking for a dexterity or stacking games that have elements of narrative storytelling or discussion any ideas are welcome one is example i ve found is a jenga game that has personal questions written on the blocks that you answer when you pull them i think it could be very cool to have a collaborative storytelling game that connects the story to the physical structure of the game dexterity games with narrative or discussion

1,after years of saying scythe is my favorite game i think res arcana just took the top spot this is largely because of the frequency that i m able to play res arcana on board game arena and since the teach is so simple i m more willing to show it to people i haven t been able to host many scythe sessions due to the pandemic and moving to a new town where it s hard to find gamers that would be interested in playing bigger games res arcana just packs so many compelling decisions into such a small game the strategy per square inch of cardstock is off the charts i m still finding new card synergies after plays what s your new favorite game and why did it supplant your old favorite game what game has taken your spot from your previously favorite game

1,it took me a little while to realize this is a completely asymmetric game once each player has a different vision it s just not predetermined at the beginning i ve wondered what would happen if it were more like pax ren where a victory condition has to be revealed by a player who wants that condition to be accessible but when it s flipped it becomes accessible to everyone rather than just the one player if someone is going to win with one of the banners another player can take the banner to keep them from winning but they can t win themselves so the rest of the game seems to be that first player working to regain the banner while others either thwart them or pursue their own win condition if that banner win became open to all i suppose everyone would then focus on the one condition maybe this wouldn t work so well what do you think oath variant idea accessible visions

1,so this is going to be a negative review as i feel a counterpoint might be needed for some people as all i see is praise and since there s much detailed info out there on rules and gameplay already i ll focus on specific weaknesses of the game action selection at first the shared action track seems awesome there s what i want to do and there s what that gives to my opponent dilemmas and conundrums abound surely well not really the simplicity of the action track might be its strength but in actuality we always felt too limited if your base assumption is that you don t want to open events to your opponents it almost feels like the game dictates you what actions to take we always felt frustrated in our limited options and there s not enough subtlety for clever maneuvering sometimes you really need to do a certain action but unless that s the case you re going to play by default in the end too much simplicity in available actions and obviousness as to optimal strategies made us feel like actual choice was very limited and that we were going through the motions especially since everything is open information add in the fact that you can math out everything when in doubt to make sure you re bored out of your mind powers and asymmetry it s a cmon game so there s going to be monsters amazing powers crazy abilities right right well i feel like the further we go from chaos of the world the more i miss its amazing asymmetry this one s so streamlined in that regard as to become bland the gods have different abilities alright a few are actually game changing across the board but many will impact one or two fights out of like after that it s all downhill we all share the same guardians and from what i ve seen yet their powers are very tame i m afraid the most interesting thing about them is that they grant extra figurines which is telling but the worst is that we all share the same ankh power boards and it s not like there s tons of options on there and most of them are akin to get a couple more bucks in some way get strength get more points when you win tehre s maybe paths that make sense so at the end of the game your gods are probably going to be more similar than when you started so everyone feels the same in their blandness which makes the game seem really dry and mechanical combat this might be a group meta thing but combat was so predictable that we almost didn t feel the need to play cards face down i m exaggerating but since everyone s got the exact same cards we re all the same remember and that everything is knowable times out of the expected outcome of a battle is the actual outcome kemet has secret divine intervention cards to spice things up a game of thrones a different combat deck per faction here we just felt like copy pasted versions of each other you can also get back all your cards very easily just have a figurine in a fight you don t care about around the middle of the combat round and you re set here goes all the tension of that mechanism sure there s the bidding with the locusts for some shenanigans well it does not really work as it s a sucker s game what s the point if the other players got more money and if you have more money and play yours if there s several locust cards in play it becomes a crapshoot it worked in rising sun because you had to weigh every bid against every other fight actions and every other following fights not so much here it ll work as intended once in a blue moon and no one will like it the merge i won t dwell on that much discussed topic it s meh most of the time the rest of the time it does not work it feels too punishing to be thrown into the merge when you could still win by yourself it does not feel good as the last player to see all your work go down the train especially if you can see it from a mile away the awkward coop is well awkward i m afraid eric lang had to suck out what made that concept great to please playtesters who felt it was too op and don t tell me that i can play without it it was touted as a central piece of design and the thematic rationale behind the game if it works so bad you have to take it out what does that say about the game here s what i ll say about the game it s not bad i ll play it if offered and it s a beautiful production and i can t deny it has flashes of brilliance steal a majority with a well played building card divide up a crucial territory with caravans i can also see it s chess like quality at players especially but personally it felt more like a soulless puzzle rather than a strategy game ankh review fading into oblivion

1,i feel like i once had played a board game a long time ago and i unfortunately only vaguely remember what the box looked like and that i enjoyed it the box was a lighter blue color i m sure and it had a silhouette of a camel on it just a filled im outline of one the box could ve had some sort of middle eastern designs on it but i am unsure the pieces you would move around are camels i am unsure if this is just one particular version of a more popular board game but perhaps someone may have an idea if anything rings a bell please let me know can anyone point me to the name of a board game i feel like i recall
1,hello so i am new to these board games and this one was on sale at a local game store decided to try it out i have only played the solo adventure so far the first one i ve tried times without winning although play throughs i was turn away from winning start your turn on the objective spaces i am having a really difficult time with it first thing i noticed was that there doesn t appear to be much i can do to avoid monsters and encounters there also isn t much strategy in fighting it boils down to rolling the d only i feel like the games damage output to me is borderline insane in a single turn i can take anywhere from damage or more i only have hp i also roll poorly dungeons amp dragons the legend of drizzt seems overly difficult wonder if i am doing something incorrectly

1,hi all does anybody have this game yet if do could you please give me the dimensions for a character piece all i need to know is the height thickness of the base the total height including the base and also the diameter or the base if anyone could do this for me i d be grateful because i can t find it anywhere and really need to know what size are the animal crossing monopoly character pieces
1,sorry to be incendiary with the title but every time i play this game i have to say i can t believe they made this a rule it s so not cool i m going to ramble a bit and for that i apologize but allow me to spin my various yarns perhaps i lack the iq required to play this game any other way but i can t fathom why it s a failing practice to do play what i d call a measured approach where you keep outbreaks in check and balance resources city event cards and still get btfo d by the card draw death timer for context i ve played the game on easy outbreaks and hard outbreaks difficulties i enjoy not playing d chess all the time so we often allow choice of player characters and only play easy mode i ve played the game been on outbreak last player last draw the board damn near covered in plague and we get the last cure and it s called a win it sure as heck doesn t feel like one i just finished a easy game where we had no outbreaks rng d into quarantine specialist dispatcher medic and used contingency planner to double up every event once and we were down to cards left had to house rule and allow players the ability to skip draw phase and draw only a single card and we still had to fudge some contingency plans to hire another charter flight to win long story short game only feels viable and fun if you re rocking medic mass infection clear is op scientist cards to cure is for some reason a lot easier than getting cards especially when used in conjunction with the researcher researcher bypassing the totally garbage poopoo stinky dumb dummy awful terrible rule where you have to be in the same city to share knowledge is a godsend whatever can go here i ve seen people equate the oe and the dispatcher but i d argue that dispatcher is the better choice especially with the use of medic as well contingency planner is okay but it s kind of lame to have your powers be contigent upon luck and not skill though you can use skill in application of the event usage quarantine specialist is okay but medic effectively replaces them when you ve got the cure and is really just great for the happenstance of an outbreak event draw with a small infection deck and early game stuff but as i said earlier clearly outbreak stats don t matter okay they do but i m being facetious i ve only done player games but basically ya just have scientist and researcher putting in the cure work while your medic and dispatcher do damage control extra positioning and mop up the board without this character setup the juggling and mental math you have to do to plan out moves just feels absurd and non intuitive to be locked into the traditional cw or ccw turn order when you re at the precipice of dang i just drew the card we need too bad we gotta wait a whole turn order to get back to this is extremely stilted i m playing with the edition that s copyright says contingency planner and quarantine specialist are new roles if that matters i heard that other editions changed their abilities but i don t know what version changed what i ve got a forum from and a reddit post from which says does anyone actually like this game lol but yeah i think that s it sorry if this wasn t super comprehensive i was admittedly typing this in the middle of game night so my train of thought might ve got derailed quite heavily i just wanna say if someone can vouch for this game or detail how they make every class setup viable or if anyone has a consistent set of house rules that don t break the game i m down to hear it i guess it s fair to say as with any game you shouldn t go in expecting to win all the time but something about this one just feels off thanks for your time in letting an insane old man ramble incoherently just chimed in to say pandemic is awfully balanced and the only way to viably play it is house rules to infinity and beyond
1,hello everyone i just wanted to share some custom dice for battlelore nd edition that i made using some blank purple dice and a cricut the finish is a little rough as i used clear nail polish on some and matte spray paint on the others to try to seal them the clear spray paint caused the stickers to shrivel and curl a little but i was able to use some clear nail to coat and kind of seal them my sister took photos of each pip of the die and used her cricut to print them out on white sticker paper we tried to size them correctly but they came out a little bigger than the original dice it still came out really good and i d recommend anyone looking for extra dice try this method if they have access to a cricut some of the pips got distorted from the spray paint but overall they are functional and i think work really well id love to hear anyone s thoughts opinions or ideas on doing a better job the finish is the only thing that makes them look uneven and splotchy so if anyone has any ideas for sealing the dice i d love to hear thanks battlelore nd edition dice using blank dice and cricut
1,dear all i played in the past a game called koopa s tycoon town on the nintendo wii console mario party where players with most hotels owned coins win the catch is others can take over your hotel if they invest an amount of coins higher than what you bought it for so if you buy it for coins the player after you will take it from you by paying coins for the hotel to koopa and you will no longer own that hotel until you add more coins to your initial investment to become higher than the current owner ofc its fraustrating because you have to reach your hotel again after going around the entire board and you must have money when you pass by it again basically i am looking for similar concepts where you make other want to punch you for taking their stuff ruining their hard work stealing that reward that they worked so hard for games that is more based on taking things from others specially when they really dont want to give those things to you please any ideas of games similar to this concept board or card games please help thank youboardgame where you take others resources rewards or simply make others really want to punch you

1,i m having a board game marathon with a couple friends in a week we re going to play scythe quantum dirty clubs kingdomino catan helpers of catan dc deck building game wonders and colossal arena i know everyone was curious and we re planning on having a meal break and i thought it would be fun to throw on like an episode of a tv show that s board game themed while we eat i m having trouble finding what i m looking for a cursory google search just shows random games that pop up in the backgrounds of shows and i m looking for tv episodes that are about the characters actually playing a game i know there s a seinfeld episode where kramer plays risk and i found a simpsons treehouse of horror where a bunch of board game pieces come to life but that s all i can come up with there s also the cones of dunshire in parks and rec but that s more of a b plot there s gotta be more right thanks for helping tv episodes about board games
1,hey guys tried doing a search here but couldn t find anything i m a former x wing player and dabbler in malifaux battletech and the batman miniature game i adore these types of games and how much depth they have and all the options especially when the different factions have their own specialties and abilities that being said it s tough to keep investing money and money in new models for different teams and factions when i know that it s a rough sell to get these to the table my main issue is game length i used to play x wing competitively but it got to be such a slog going to the game store every weekend for hours only to get only or maybe games in total if i was lucky i find it hard to justify playing a game where the minimum time requirement usually after familiarity with rules and units is minutes to an hour at least i know some games of battletech or k can last hours and that s awesome but highly unrealistic for my current circumstances i m curious if anyone has any recommendations for a board game or even actual skirmish game like the ones mentioned above that is similar in feel but shorter in game time bonus points for multiple factions variety but it wouldn t be a necessity im hoping for average of minutes with potentially shorter times once the rules are known and players are familiar with the game in general looking for board game that scratches the skirmish war game itch but in less time

1,so i decided to buy decks of cards and combine them to make a cheap deck to play cockroach poker with but i can t find any pdf of the rules or any videos detailing the rules of the game i understand the basics of the game but i was hoping to get some clarifications on some specific questions i have mostly regarding the royal variant can you only pass a card to the player next to you like an agreed upon left or right circle that all cards pass around to or can you pass to anyone when playing with royal cards is announcing a card as being royal mandatory or is that optional when played how do the special royal cards work that don t fall into a specific animal type cockroach poker royal rules clarification

light games most recently purchased parks hansa teutonica big box red rising got as a birthday gift paraga caput ragni games i have sold majesty small filler game that just didn t have enough depth to it for me and my gaming group to enjoy isle of skye decent game we would rather play carcassonne didn t get played because of it troyes i thought it was a great game the ratios were awkward the game didn t feel as elegant as it could have been viceroy the card mechanics and pyramid building was great the auction part of the game wasn t as smooth with my gaming group kinsgburg too long for what it is it is a dice chucker would rather play dice forge someone else in my gaming group also owns it so no need to have it in my collection keyflower auction mechanic was great the tile use was decent as well just didn t get to the table we always seemed to pick another game too many games to choose from first world problem i know steam punch rally over played this game with my daughter probably played it times really enjoyed the time with it and my daughter just didn t feel like playing it anymore what would you change about your collection if you could not much i have focused on games that i can play solo this happened even before the pandemic i find i really like to play a game by myself to quiet my mind and get my thoughts off work i will probably get rid of a few games as my youngest is starting to enjoy more complex game i really love crunchy heavier multiple strategy games i am well aware i have a tendency to enjoy worker placement games and tableau building games i find i love the puzzle and the progression as well as the optimization to what is available to you not a fan of party games they are ok with large groups but i don t seem to enjoy the game as much as it is the social aspect with friends games that are leaving my collection soon sushi go kingdomino taco cat goat cheese pizza karuba tusro of the seas not shown my watch or next purchase list xia legends of a drift system lisboa glen more ii plus highland games expansion for solo experience res arcana trickerion legends of illusions grand austria hotel games that i really enjoy that my gaming group has in

each game i have played i always end up in the brig or i have been air locked root it is basically dudes on a map with abilities you can get targeted and eliminated not a huge fan of elimination games period gloomhaven the card mechanics are great and the progression of a character and customization is good as well it is just too much game for a long period of time maybe not a fan of a game dominating multiple sessions i think i prefer variety spirit island not a fan of co op games the gaming group has some really smart people in it and it becomes a quarterbacking session not a fan of co ops because of this blood rage played it a few times don t like the rock paper scissors mechanic with the cards our group gets together once a week with the occasional holiday or weekend gaming session for longer games always get together over the christmas new years break to get in a games day look forward to this every year currently playing at my place unless something comes up this is the space that we play i have also been tracking plays with my bgg for years now and on average for the last years i get in games a year i am really content with that really appreciate that i have a

1,contains spoilers about mechanics and late game content read at your own risk amp xb amp xb we just finished last night and in the course of completing december we found what seems to be a loophole gt i was our infiltration specialist and had several assets to improve my abilities that included the one that gives you action tokens when you use the enter exit infiltration site action well we were in a bit of a pickle and it seemed like i could step in use an action point gain and then step out use an action point gain to get a hand literally full of action points a net gain of two tokens every time you step in and out i also had a visa to novosibirsk so i was able to return there easily and had an allied card that made it easy to fly out of there repeatedly lt this was only or turns before the end of the game and we carefully tracked what happened and we would have won either way but it did seem a little ridiculous gt that on one turn i traveled the world several times and cleared off units lt are we missing something or is this a late game loophole that the designers just missed in playtesting pandemic legacy season loophole spoilers
1,hey all we are enjoying regicide a lot and it s hitting our table regularly that s why i came up with some variants here is an interactive and synergetic set of three variants the first two variants provide advantages that increase the design space for players whereas the last variant increases the challenge that the enemies pose although i recommend playing altogether as they balance each other you could use the first two variants if your group finds the game hard what do you think let me know if you could test these variants interactive and synergistic variants for regicides

1,for context in disney villainous wicked to the core each player has locations for the evil queen one of these locations the dwarfs cottage is locked and players may not play heroes on locations while they are locked snow white is a hero card that reads snow white can only be played to the dwarfs cottage even if it is locked my interpretation of these rules is that snow white cannot be played if the cottage is locked if the cottage is locked then a hero cannot be played there and the text on snow white simply forbids her from being played anywhere else meaning she cannot go anywhere if snow white were playable then the card would have to read snow white can only be played to the dwarfs cottage and can even if it is locked i can be convinced that this is what was meant by the designers but i keep winding everyone up by claiming that in that case the wording is incorrect and that i am still correct the other interpretation that everyone else rolls with is that the even if it is locked is there just to negate the normal rules that a hero can only be played on unlocked locations which makes sense in a casual way but that just isn t how i interpret those rules i don t see how i am wrong i m aware this is just being pedantic but can someeeebodyyy out there help settle this argument the full rules are available online if you don t trust my writing reading ppedantic rules reading help

1,the best parks has a storage tray that maximizes use of space with perfectly shaped slots leaving no question where to put each component i also like that the plastic insert doesn t have an outer edge which eliminates wasted space by using the walls of the box to keep components snugly in place it also has cleverly shaped resource trays that can be used both for storage and as resource supply banks on either side of the table during gameplay the components fill the box to the brim but you never have to strain to get it all to fit making for a very satisfying setup and tear down experience the worst rush n crush shows a complete disregard for space efficiency both inside the box and on my shelf you could fit more copies of this game inside box when you open the box you are greeted by a mess of free floating road tiles once you fish all those out you ll laugh at the single tiny nook in the cardboard insert that holds the dice cars hazards and other tokens what are the best and worst storage inserts you ve seen what games have the best and worst storage inserts
1,in the last week i started playing some games of the crew on bga i have some experience with the game irl getting close to mission with my friends to put it mildly it is not new player friendly at all early on there were a few ways people were communicating or not communicating that my friends and i had not done some i understood instantly a few not until after the game and having a look back at the play log each mistake even when we still easily won the mission results in someone rage quitting in one instance someone rage quit over playing extra trick after or so games i understood the meta and stopped making easy mistakes and made it to mission with a group the group had a few failures but we talked between retries and kept pushing until someone needed to leave for work it was super fun and i learnt quite a bit about the game added them all as friends to try and get a more reliable game going more often tried to play another times today never made it beyond mission because of rage quitting this time though it was from the mistakes of other new players to try and remedy this from happening if i work out who quits like this i thumbs down and say i would not like to play with them again what i don t understand is why these elitist players do not adjust there search criteria to avoid new players if the game ends after new players make minor mistakes how are they supposed to improve is this experience the normal or have i being unlucky with the players i have paired with so far playing the crew on bga

1,hi all my boyfriend and i recently moved away from our friends we regularly played board games with therefore we are looking for great board games that play well with just people favorite board games for players need suggestions
1,so over the last few game nights we had a rather heated argument among some of our regular players i want to hear the community s feedback and ill break it down into to sub disagreements amp xb is it okay for players to make comments about the current state of the game for example we are playing a game where the victory condition is reaching points player says hey guys player just got his th point and there is a good chance he ll end the game next round do you find it reasonable what if he adds let s try and block him from winning what if player elaborates and shares his analysis with the rest of the players for example player just had scored their th point but we should remember that he has this card which can land him an easy point and next round he can do x y and z to achieve another so he might end the game amp xb is it okay to suggest to other players what to do not just you should do this more like hey remember that this rule applies in this situation what if player reminds player about a rule that benefits player or something along the lines of player remember that you can use x to make player lose y amp xb i would love to hear your opinions on this subject and if you can elaborate your reasoning that would be splendid do you allow commenting on the current state of the game or suggesting an action
1,i understand that making a product and setting a price is a very complex system but it really feels like some games are priced at random i m in australia and over the last couple of years i ve bought the following games for generally the same price terraforming mars gugong a feast for odin teotihuacan these are four different designers and the quality of game has no correlation to the price gugong and teo were both and great productions also popular games feast for odin was big ol box and good production plastic trays etc terraforming mars was is like a print and play now i didn t come here to add to the tm quality hate there s enough of that already but my question is how do publishers justify doing a poor excellent job on quality if it doesn t seem to have a huge impact on pricing is it all fall out from the kickstart vs traditional model question about board game production and pricing

1,hi everyone i ve been into board game for the past years and have slowly been building and culling my collection over time here it is as it stands and some mini reviews thoughts to go along with it as well as future games i m thinking of trying out and would love to hear your opinions on pictures will come later i m currently on vacation and have some spare time bored so thought i d type this up but just imagine your generic kallax shelf with all the games packed in the common theme i ve realized over the past ten years as i was discovering board games is that i love elegant design masterpiece true classic type games fun factor packaged into one elegant design meaning simple design not overly complex rules or a plethora of tons of mechanisms to make it seem like the game is very deep and complex but instead keeps it relatively simple and has a lot of crunch strategy tactics fun factor is important too i realized after playing splendor times that although it is definitely elegant it s just not fun for me felt like work and was just bored while waiting for my friend to finish his turn i discovered knizia relatively late but i feel like a lot of his games fall under this elegant design category so you can see below that i own a lot of his masterpieces i also try to avoid the new cult and try to avoid buying games released in the past or years until the hype has died down and people have a better understanding of how much of a masterpiece the game is and will become a true classic player battle line love this as a two player game so simple but so tense lost cities this game is higher on the fun factor but a bit too much luck involved still fun enough to not get rid of but don t play as much anymore jaipur fun little game not much depth but just a fun filler and an elegant design race for the galaxy mvp of player games my most played player game its just so elegant how this game is designed how a card is a good method of payment but also something to build etc just love this innovation recent acquisition have not yet played player medium sized groups babylonia love this game can t stop thinking about this just so crunchy but really simple rules a truly elegant masterpiece of game design think this will become one of knizia s classics in the same realm as tigris and others tigris amp euphrates finally got a hold of this game paying a scalper s price but so worth it so deep so strategic another elegant masterpiece i understand why this is considered a classic dominion i own most of the expansions was addicted to this game for a year or two but rarely play it now because after playing online for a while i find the constant shuffling tedious and i try to avoid online gaming b c i like playing physical games concordia one of the most elegantly design games i ve played feels like the pinnacle superior catan relatively easy to teach hansa teutonica recently acquired have not played the estates recently acquired have not played dominant species love this game super fun to play trying to get it to hit the table more but the issue has been the length of the game puerto rico recently acquired have not played acquire recently acquired have not played eclipse love this game super fun to play mostly played on my ipad but looking forward to some physical gaming time with this ethnos recently acquired have not played high society recently acquired have not played modern art love this so elegantly designed a beautiful pure auction game a forever classic keeper for me power grid huge fan of this game a true classic big groups el grande recently acquired have not played cosmic encounter really fun game simple but the social interaction in this game and the lol moments are amazing chinatown recently acquired have not played really big groups for sale the most perfectly designed filler auction game for me it s so simple and fun haven t found anyone who doesn t like it really elegant design with the double auction phases bohnanza another filler game when i m in the mood for some negotiation resource trading avalon resistance the pinnacle of social deduction bluffing game for me really fun really simple but a ton of social crunch to the game games i sold culled dixit too simple for what it is got bored catan my first gateway game that i realized had a lot of flaws battlestar galactica fell flat for me thought avalon is just a better pure expression of the game and the traitor card checks felt too contrived terra mystica overcomplicated messy pile of a game that thinks of mechanisms depth galaxy trucker the only part of the game that is fun is the initial spaceship construction phase after that s over the rest is pretty boring gloomhaven jotl ugh so much work to setup play through scenarios etc just feels like a board game that tries too hard to be diablo i d rather just play diablo wonders a game that was really popular when it first came out and people still rave about i ve played it a bunch of times i think the mechanisms are way too contrived and the game just isn t very fun i don t think this is a very elegant game splendor an elegant game but just a snoozefest i kind of dreaded playing this so just sold it wingspan beautiful components but very shallow gameplay most of the birds do similar things a few overpowered birds like the raven or gull means that if you have it it s basically auto win sold it after i realized this and played many times games i m thinking of buying and would love to hear your opinion on whether i should get it based on my tastes above i m looking for masterpiece true classics that will withstand the tests of time super fun factor castles of burgundy board game every raves about this being a classic and an elegant design board game the big turnoff is the theme seems very dry and poorly designed is it still worth it will only be playing player for this game five tribes mostly considering this for p since that s my most played and i need some more variety seems kind of interesting worth getting targi again considering for p seems kind of interesting but i m not entirely sure if i would like it inis people have been raving about this game mostly want to play p i m a bit worried about the new cult hype factor here and whether this game actually is as good as it is and if it truly is an elegant masterpiece of a game that will become a classic worth it keyflower another game considered a classic but theme seems kind of dry to me worth getting comc my board game collection of elegant masterpieces true classics fun factor that i ve built over the last years

1,i m a fan of board games but my wife isn t much and we ve determined a big part of that is their dyscalculia for those that don t know discalculia is the mathematical equivalent of dyslexia where people with it struggle with arithmetic but also things like spatial reasoning are affected as well the long and short is asking someone with dyscalculia to play most board games is like asking someone with dyslexia to play scrabble they can do it but there ll be frustration and it won t be fully enjoyable now for my birthday i m wanting to visit a board game cafe with a big selection of games and my wife is willing to come with me and pay games even if it s not their cup of tea because it s my birthday while i m sure we ll play some things that interest me i was wondering if there were any suggestions for games that might be more suitable for someone with dyscalculia that we can both enjoy board game suggestions for discalculia

1,i have listened to svwag praise this game intermittently for a while and i came across a used copy on the cheap so i picked it up this game is absolute gold and i m kind of surprised it isn t talked about more let me break it down a bit for those not in the know sci fi theme there s a new section of space that is accessible through the eponymous warpgates that each faction has access to the goal is to maneuver your spaceships around this area of space to collect the most points before the end game triggers that s admittedly pretty blasé but the mechanics and interactions make this game shine first of all the variability is off the charts unique asymmetric factions to choose from and variable board set up and a set amount of research cards are put into play research cards break the game for you in certain ways as you earn them the gameplay is rather unique each player gets a deck of action cards that contain different actions and you pull from your deck each round each player takes actions per round and each faction gets a player board where typically there is a x a x a x and a x action where x is the variable of the action card you play so for instance if you want to bring more ships into play you can play that action card but if you play it on the first turn you only bring in one ship and on the fourth turn you would bring in trying to plan when to bring in ships move your ships take control of planets research new tech or attack is an incredibly satisfying puzzle speaking of attacking combat is equally satisfying each faction gets their own deck of tactics cards which start off identical save for your one hero card you start with combat is simple you draw cards your opponent draws and you both choose to play each card has a multiplier on it so you use it to multiply by how many ships you have in the combat to get your combat strength highest strength wins but each card also has a different effect so you could theoretically win the combat but lose all your ships you committed to a card effect it s a bit of a bluffing and timing game it can also feel a tad unfair because you are only drawing cards to choose from but attackers win ties and there is an action that lets you add more and better tactics cards to your deck all of this is done in order to set yourself up to fulfill your objectives when end game hits l to score big all at once or run trade routes as often as possible to score a bunch of incremental points throughout the game or more likely a combination of both now that i write it out the game seems pretty generic but there is something very special about it i guess i can t put my finger on i guarantee a good time if nothing else it s a very clean and elegant design and it plays fast it also comes with an optional variant i haven t tried yet that litters the board with exploration tokens it makes the game extremely more random so i get why it was left off as a variant but seems like it would be fun to dive into one day check out warpgate if you can any love for warpgate

1,many games have rules that can be interpreted differently and my regular gaming group aren t averse to implementing a few here and there depedning upon the game do you guys use any that others might find useful or maybe you ve got some quirky fun amusing ones for certain games for example my regular gaming group are currently arguing over how oozes split in gloomhaven they just take two damage by the rules but that doesn t seem fair when oozes get tougher at later level so we ve changed the splitting damage to which is what happens when a level ooze splits aside from that we re very strict about not giving ourselves any kind of advantage really house rules do you use any or are you strictly by the book

1,i ve been on a bit of a spree lately in the last months i ve bought about new games now part of this is because i ve only recently become obsessed with board games upon learning they can actually be fun with players as well as groups but before then i really only played catan for what i considered strategic games now that i know what s out there i ve gone a bit ham i m assuming this will level out soon even though all i can seem to do is look at reviews and find the next game i want even when i ve got some already on the way i m curious for those well into the hobby does this peter out eventually to where you re only buying a new game every month or couple months even or did i just find myself a dangerously addicting new hobby how often do you buy new games
1,i m curious how often people will play the same game will you play a game you really like every week twice a week or go a month in between to keep it fresh for me when i get a new game and i like it i ll play it times in a week if my gf is willing and enjoys it as well sometimes even twice in a day if it s a home run for both of us i m somewhat new to the hobby so as my collection fills out i can see this changing slightly as there will be more to choose from and you can only play so many games in a week but regardless when i enjoy a game especially a new one all i want to do is play it that being said i do get sick of games for example we got wingspan and it was really our only player game at the time and the one that really introduced us to the hobby in addictive kind of way we played it like times a week for half a year covid fun but now i m pretty sick of it and want to avoid doing that to other games the reason for my long winded question outside of general curiosity is beacuse i want to get a better idea of what replayability means to everyone so when i read reviews and people rate the replayability high i have an better idea of what it actually means i assumed high replayability and high ratings meant i could play it every week minimum for months on end and still love it but i just read a blog where someone rated a game super high and then followed that up by saying they only play it once every few months which really threw me for a loop how often do you play the same game

1,i just played my first game of galaxy trucker and whilst enjoyable i feel like the game is not well designed in terms of the punishment for making mistakes later in the game i comfortably won flights i and ii but made a crucial error in my ship on flight iii ultimately making it useless and dead in the water the points everybody won in flight iii far outstripped the points i won in i ii combined so not only were the first two flights basically pointless as they had no impact for me but i also had to sit and watch the last flight and not take part essentially meaning i hadn t really played am i missing something or is this poor design a single moment of error placing one tile effectively made everything else i had achieved so far meaningless and meant i had to sit and watch the last round the values of the flights are such that you only really need to play the iii flight did i just have an unlucky game or is this poor design i m leaning towards the latter but willing to have my mind changed by more experienced players i have only played one game after all am i missing something about galaxy trucker
1,i mean a game solved where one of the players can easily predict the outcome of the match just by imagining the best moves for both sides and going through forced variants just like a tic tac toe which you can easily tie or win but never lose because it s easy to predict the whole game after two or three moves a game of dominoes in which you can see your opponent s pieces and he can see yours would that be a deterministic game

1,this game is really amazing i was a bit worried at first because of the bgg weight rating and having to teach it to my play group but the way the game communicates its mechanics and how the different departments flow together to create this order within a chaos of mechanics is really really cool teaching of course took a while min hr because of the shear quantity of things in the game but felt clear and concise for what it is once we got going everyone felt like they were on even ground and no one really felt at a disadvantage due to randomness or forgetting a mechanic it was white hot from turn there are so many options while still being super tight i ve played games so far and they ve all taken less than hours and most even less than hours what other games are this clean and tight while still being this complex terraforming mars is cool but i just can t be bothered to play a potentially hr long game anymore i really enjoy everdell hansa teutonica tigris amp euphrates gugong and a lot of other worker placement abstract strategy euro games but none are on this level gugong is maybe the closest are other lacerda games like this i m skeptical of lisboa but i m intrigued by the gallerist now that i ve gotten some kanban ev under my belt just played kanban ev for the first time holy cow what other games are like this

1,this is something that s been in the back of my mind for a while and agricola on bga kind of put it up front how does everyone feel about variants in boardgames that are stuffed in the back of the manual as suggestions do you think they re helpful or should the designer have a vision in mind when creating a game with all the rules in place to support that vision some examples the draft variant in terraforming mars which i m sure is how most people at not sure why it s even a variant the sons of anarchy boardgame has a ton of variants in the back to mix and match and to bring it back to agricola you draft minor improvements and occupations at the beginning of the game but bga gives you the option to draft those from either or total cards does everyone like all these options or do they just serve to muddy the waters boardgaming variants and a curated experience

1,my friends and i get together every week or so to play board games together i recently got into the hobby so we ve been trying out a few of the games that i ve been getting also trying to get games they want too but i m a little worried that they don t want to get into more involved games like terraforming mars or oath the games they like the most are simpler like here to slay or monopoly i find them extremely boring because of the very little depth there is to those games when we played root they liked it but would much prefer simpler games naming here to slay especially is there anything i can do to try to sway them more into the hobby how should i try to get my friends into board games

1,big shelf big shelf pic big shelf pic shelf shelf at the top i should mention i play games almost exclusively player with my partner it s very very rare that we play in a bigger group as far as i m concerned every game in my collection is really fun with two so if any people out there are looking for some beefier player recomendations hopefully i can help as we play only player one thing that doesn t bother us at all is multiplayer solitaire in fact in a lot of cases we prefer less interaction and just like to build and execute our plans not always the case though if you can t tell i love a dry euro top games i honestly don t know on any day it could be any one of the games on the main shelves but current heavy rotation are orleans with expansions glen more ii troyes any stean feld game currently enjoying amerigo bonus best small box game paris la cite de la lumiere girlfriend s favourite games orleans amp grand austria thoughts on some games amazing game no one talks about but should keyper everyone loves keyflower and rightly so but its follow up is insane it s technically a very open worker placement game but with so many interesting twists i m still trying to figure out any kind of strategy it retains the core keyflower concept of meeples not being your own and sacrificing meeples to the better actions but intertwined it with an efficiency game bit of a brain burner game i ve had the longest but yet to play i ve owned war of the ring for over a year but still not finished painting the minis games on the wishlist marco polo trickerion barrage lorenzo waiting for the big box any lacerda impossible to find in the uk plus lots more games backed on kickstarter carnegie darwin s journey and the robinson crusoe book games that are possibly on their way out scythe i don t find the choices very interesting unfortunately and ironically even though i m into super dry euros i find scythe a bit bland inis it s fine i don t like the battle mechanic and again just a little boring spirit island it s just not clicking played it a few times and i m just not sure i like it very much i can expand if this if requested awkward guests enjoyed this a lot at first but quickly realised there s no actual deduction just the illusion of deduction also reorganising the cards into the correct order at the end of the game is hell on earth it takes way longer than it should ask away about any games you might be curious about comc two years in and very happy with our player euro heavy collection

1,img jpg hey i ve been playing and collecting games since and i am proud to admit that boardgames are my first hobby ever i am really passionate about it all began in my childhood when i was playing games such as catan and monopoly with my brother and sister almost every day on summer holidays later on i played risk and munchkin with my friends oftentimes it wasn t until october last year when i realized that boardgames can be a serious hobby and there is much more to discover than the aforementioned games and so my journey began and a whole new universe opened up for me my top games atm are brass birmingham aeon s end gloomhaven spirit island arkham horror lcg as you can see i do love cooperative games but i also love competitive games i just play coop more often because my girlfriend won t play competitive games with me i would love to play games like tta or twilight imperium more often what i would change i m looking for a good area control game which works good from p up kemet is top on my wishlist but doesn t work good at i think if you have any recommendations for me regarding my request or otherwise feel free to leave a comment also i cannot finish this post without mentioning how much i love arkham horror lcg we currently purchased everything until the forgotten age and three scenario packs when i bought the first core set half a year ago i thought i would play it solo and already feared that i d like it because i knew it would become costly but i started playing it with my gf who loves it too and so we share the cost and spending money on things you love doesn t really hurt anyways we have played every campaign at least three times except tfa and will keep playing as we love playing all the different investigators thanks for reading and i m looking forward to seeing your recommendations ps bgg collection for a detailed list comc have been collecting for about a year now
1,having some confusion with the rules if a blue card i play says action spend mc to gain plants does that mean i spend mc and move my little green cube to the space or does it mean that i take two bronze cubes and place them on my plant area or both i m struggling to understand when i move my cube marker and when i take mc s and place them on the heat and leaf areas i have a green card that says during production phase this produces heat so move my cube take mc and place it on that area or both terraforming mars ares question
1,so i ve been recently playing a lot of tigris and i don t understand what the point of external conflicts are let s say that i start building my kingdom and add a ton of green tiles to my kingdom say tiles with my trader connected to the kingdom obviously to earn the green points so i ve collected green points in total let s say i m attacking my rivals kingdom which has green tiles to it why would i do this the problem i see is that you win in tigris with the least amounts of points in any color so even if i beat my rival kingdom and i gain green points one for each of the tiles destroyed i likely have more green points already than any other color so it just gets me more points in a color i don t need furthermore it s actually taking unnecessary risk because if i lose the conflict because they put up hidden tiles from their hand then presumably i helped them more than i would ve gained myself because they destroy six of my green tiles and earn those as points and because their kingdom had less green tiles placed than me they earn the points to their benefit since the color is likely one where they have less points in i just don t get why i would ever start an external conflict i guess you can play the situation in reverse lets say my kingdom only has green tiles placed and my rival kingdom has green tiles and i decide to attack the other kingdom to boost my green points but that seems to be very risky even if i had a hand of green tiles hidden to play and win the conflict if my rival has just or two green hidden tiles to play i automatically lose and started a war for nothing i just don t get why in any situation you d want to start an external conflict tigris amp euphrates strategy talk what is the point of an external conflict war

lets you see a complete list of all the monsters in king of tokyo so i decided to compile one here i m possibly missing a few promotional and national monsters so please help me fill in the gaps if you see any that i ve missed in each table all monsters are compatible with both king of tokyo kot and king of new york kony all monsters are also compatible with king of tokyo dark edition kot d but

the monster has evolution cards to be played in king of tokyo power up and king of new york power up respectively a blank cell means no evolution cards exist while a filled cell tells you where the

1,i had this feeling when playing kemet all the high level power tiles make you feel like an invincible god but with so many amazing power tiles everyone feels game breakingly powerful when they pick up a new tile the game stays balanced because when everyone s super no one will be what other games give you this feeling of being overpowered but it s not actually game breaking games are exciting when everything feels overpowered and therefore balanced
1,as the tittle requestes i would like to read your opinions on the matter i am thinking about buying a few games i am thinking about buying a more serious game i am torn between scythe brass birmingham and cosmic encounter i already have terraforming mars i want to try a legacy game for now the main contender is pandemic legacy as i have the original and i really enjoy it i have read several reviews about season one and i believe it is the one i will be buying but if you have any suggestion it s more than welcome regarding the two player game i have thought about unmatched santorini or onitama i already have patchwork amp wonders duel what are your thoughts do you have any other suggestions i m all ears suggestions for board game legacy game and two player game
1,does a site exist like goodreads where daily or weekly giveaways exist for board games board game giveaways
1,all three arrived today the plan is to play one now and keep the others for another time i just bought them while they were in stock which isn t very often near me my wife has been getting into board games recently but we never play games of this weight and i don t want to scare her off her choice in terms of theme would be on mars or lisboa but we ll want to go with whichever of the three will be least intimidating any suggestions and reasons would be awesome thanks on mars lisboa or kanban ev which one first
1,tl dr the immense variety of cards my so and i have been pondering over why we love tm so much and why it s the game that has seen the most playtime within our group of friends it s a game we love so much but it s also a game we rarely play player with because it can drag on for quite a while we ve looked into a lot of games that people have recommended to us based on our love for terraforming mars underwater cities viticulture res arcana we really enjoyed both res arcana and viticulture great games though not quite like tm but it was after playing a couple of games of underwater cities which we didn t like that we discovered why we love tm so much while the gameplay of uc was fine we were really bored and disappointed in the large amount of duplicate cards so many cards that are named the same and do the same while also being quite boring while in terraforming mars there is just a literal mountain of different cards with different effects with different art it s so exciting to draw new cards because you never know what you ll get we also recently bought a used copy of clank with adventuring party and sunken treasures which we ve also had a blast with and played many many times with our friends and i firmly believe one of the reasons for why we also enjoy clank as much as we do is because of the sheer volume of different cards sure there are duplicates but there are so many cards in the deck that it s not all that often that we stumble upon them pun intended clank and tm are great games that are in my opinion made better by the large volume and variety of cards as opposed to a tighter deck so yeah now that we ve figured that out what are some other games that you feel like would fit this i figured out why my group loves terraforming mars so much what other games can scratch the same itch
1,hi guys this is my first post in this subreddit so hello everyone i used to play a lot warhammer with my group but we just don t have the time anymore to meet for weekend long warhammer sessions however we still meet regularly to play board games i really miss the miniature painting aspect of warhammer and that s why i am looking for a nice game for our group players that has lots of miniatures that i can paint i researched a little bit and found descent and zombicide green horde what do you think about theses two games or do you have even better other recommendations we are actually open for any kind of game but prefer fantasy and ancient mythology settings e g greek egyptian vikings we are also big fans of starwars lord of the rings and game of thrones if this helps thank you so much looking for a game with many paintable miniatures
1,hi guys weird question i think some friends and i are about to publish a board game which takes a twist on fantasy tropes the game has lots of silly or satirical things but also epic looking artwork so we tried to make the look of our website as odd as possible to make it clear we are not offering the usual fantasy experience this oddity includes having a sexy button on the front page which leads you to the playtesting page where you can join our sexy community we just meant it as attractive and exciting didn t consider it could be offensive or make anybody uncomfortable but somebody on discord didn t like it and described a sexy button as wrong on so many levels is this person over sensitive or is there something to it what are your thoughts our game is very particular and we know we will somehow offend somebody we make fun of everything and the opposite of everything but we always tried to do it without taking sides and without offending anybody to give you an example one of the playable heroes is a pregnant mother with many children and we playtested the game with pregnant women to make sure they found it enjoyable which they did the game itself contains much less pointless sexualization than most other fantasy games i have played if there is something wrong with the word that we haven t considered we ll change it no problems if it s a matter of over sensitivity maybe we should actually leave it so that the game doesn t get in the wrong hands we have some mild sex jokes and when you attack you roll and aim die and may hit somebody in the butt if the word sexy makes you uncomfortable maybe other things of this game which we cannot change will make you even more uncomfortable any comment appreciated but please be respectful both of our game as we are trying to do our best and of people with different opinion then yours as they may have extremely good reason to be sensitive to a topic thanks antoniois the word sexy taboo in board games
1,me and my partner are looking to go to the next level in our board game collection we definitely could say that we play games as a hobby but so far we mainly own and thus play most often lightweight games such as catan isle of skye but we like journeyman expansion that made things quite more complex bloodborne the card game or the guildhall card games we are looking forward to getting into more advanced more content and mechanic heavy games we are not afraid of making a significantly larger jump in terms of complexity than just going to games that are better a bit more complex catan or games such as smallworld that are still very light at the same time it should be ideally a game that provides a good introduction to a world of more advanced more complex games introducing concepts such as engine building multiple overlapping mechanics and generally larger more epic scale some of the games we ve been looking at and they should give you an overview of the level of complexity we are considering are scythe terraforming mars dead of winter mansions of madness nd edition eldritch horror root or even war of the ring although the last two especially war of the ring look like they might be too much for us for now we mostly play in groups between and players so that amount of players is a must feel free to ask any questions if you d like to know more to make a better recommendation good introduction to advanced board games
1,i mean the skip card really doesn t offer anything you re playing a card to skip your turn it s essentially the same thing as playing any other card you re sill playing a card so you re really not skipping your turn lol and the reverse card if anything it gives the other person the advantage if you re playing with two people it ll give you the advantage of playing again but if you re playing with or more people you re telling the guy that played just before you to play another card which is kinda the point and goal of the game is to get the least cards so you could win uno so if anything you re actually helping them get to that goal more so yeah you ll be playing twice too since you re still playing another card after their new turn but still unless it isn t a very competitive game for you then why would you wanna give someone another turn lol these are just things that i ve noticed from playing minutes of the uno game online uno does anyone else think the skip and reverse cards are kinda useless
1,a board game version of minecraft you have been living under a rock if you haven t heard of minecraft which has has easily become the world s best selling video game of all time since it first came out for pc in in minecraft players are using pixelated blocks to build a d world which they explore with the help of items that they craft along the way it offers a massive sandbox to play in and the fact that it has endless ways to develop gives it massive appeal its success has spawned spin off video games films books and all kinds of other merchandise so a transition to the world of board games was inevitable we ve already seen two card games produced by mattel minecraft card game and uno minecraft but both of these were light and simple games that cynics would consider to be minecraft themed money grabs so up to the plate stepped ravensburger with minecraft builders amp biomes which was released in to coincide with minecraft s th anniversary gameplay as the game s title suggests minecraft builders amp biomes is effectively the board game version of the popular video game minecraft and it does a very good job of evoking the minecraft theme with most elements of the video game well represented players select two different actions each turn and gather blocks from a resource cube or explore the overworld to build structures fight mobs and collect weapons collecting resources and using them to craft buildings is an important way to earn points and so is using weapons to fight mobs as you play building structures and creating forest desert mountain and tundra biomes on your personal board the beloved video game gets a real chance to come to life on your dining room table if you re coming from the video game it all seems instantly familiar you re mining materials from the custom resource cube building structures and exploring the overworld but you also have to deal with the threat of familiar minecraft villains like endermen and creepers taking them on in combat with the help of weapons you collect and you should always be on the alert for poisonous potatoes once the resources from the cube have been exhausted will you be the builder with the most points thus winning the game impressions the gameplay is easy to learn making things straight forward for teaching and playing yet despite the relatively simple rules there are meaningful choices that make it satisfying to play this mix of simplicity and strategy make it ideal for both children and adults and also ensures that it meets the criteria needed to be considered a solid euro serious gamers may find the random elements of combat somewhat frustrating but overall you ll find that the game play is very solid with just the right mix of luck and strategy the way the resource cube works is one of the game s real highlights some aspects about the components leave something to be desired but their quality does correspond to the very affordable price point the end result is a game particularly well suited to children and families it also comes with a simplified variant for beginners but has enough going on to ensure it is also satisfying for adults minecraft builders and biomes is better than most licensed games that are based on an intellectual property in fact many gamers were pleasantly surprised by how good it is and found it to be much better than they were expecting hard core gamers may find the random elements that are part of combat somewhat of a negative but given the intended audience you can appreciate why this has been incorporated into the game the way that it has kids aren t typically thwarted easily by luck and this aspect of gameplay will even be one of the highlights for them meanwhile there s still plenty of other aspects of the game to keep adults coming back for more due to the many meaningful strategic decisions that good gameplay requires even if you re unfamiliar with minecraft this still stands up well as a good game independent of its theme but it is pretty much a must have if you enjoy minecraft and all the more so if you have kids that are minecraft fans and if you re hungry for more pick up the very good farmer s market expansion that was released in and which adds more to the game recommendation minecraft builders amp biomes has achieved exactly what it set out to do which is bring the essence of minecraft to a board game and turn it into a well themed game that is easy to learn fun to play and yet gives plenty of scope for rewarding gameplay and decision making many licensed games rely heavily on the intellectual property behind them to succeed and are found wanting when evaluated purely on the level of game that s definitely not the case here not only does this game do an excellent job of turning minecraft s core elements into a tabletop game but it is successful and satisfying as a game in its own right even for those unfamiliar with the original video game that says a lot about what minecraft builders amp biomes really accomplishes recommendation minecraft builders amp biomes offers a good range of strategic choices while also remaining easy and fun to play for children and adults alike regardless of whether or not you ve played the successful video game that this is based on if there are people in your house that love minecraft then this is a must have and even if you re just looking for a family game that s simply a good euro to play with or without the kids this may just fit the bill impressions of minecraft builders amp biomes the world s most successful digital game comes to your tabletop
1,i have the base marvel champions but want to add a deck or two to it which ones are your favourite and why can be heroes or villains marvel champions favourite card packs
1,hey all i was wondering if anyone else shared this opinion like sure cardboard gets the job done is very easy to mass produce and isn t necessarily even bad since the print on it might make it cool enough however i feel like just a box full of essentially all cardboard pieces feels boring like there isn t much interesting tactile materials on board games sometimes they would put cheap plasticy bits in which i guess can be good but honestly whenever i see it i just think come on really all this dressing up nice d art and here is this plastic mess that you just cheaped out on basically i just feel like the presentation packaging and materials used in board games while cheap and easy to mass create really loses the potential to shine as you could use so many different materials or ways of producing things for a board game that make it look gorgeous do you know of any games that went the extra mile with what they chose packaging wise material wise and presentation wise imagine the beautifulness of a chess set owned by someone wealthy or even just a couple metal pieces within a board game or just some extra minor flair that really made it feel a bit more high end let me know if you have or know of anything like this a majority of boardgame materials feel too cheap
1,hi i am very excited about my friend s game about día de muertos he s been designing board games for a few years now and when i think about known mexican theme board games usually they re done by foreigners ofrendados takes a super important mexican tradition and makes it a fun and nostalgic board game if you ve heard about this date altars and you see all the face painted calaveras symbolizing the death but you are not well acquainted with the history of it you keep wondering where does this tradition actually comes from or what does it mean i suggest you get this game ofrendados camino al mictlán his kickstarter ends in days and i really hope his project completes all the stretch goals he plans to achieve i just wanted to share it because as a mexican it s meaningful to see this type of game out there coming from our mexican roots it s an example of how much the board game industry has grown and embraced new cultures if you re interested find the kickstarter here available in english a board game about día de muertos made by mexican people

1,so in my group i tend to have mid week mixed game days and a rotation of events on saturdays this saturday we did a micro game tournament we had players total a few had just dropped i brought out games and we picked the that were picked were kingdomino pentago onitama hanamikoji the format was that you d partner up with person play each game once then get a new partner and repeat best overall record not counting me wins of the other players is a young sharp gamer the other two were slightly older and more casual gamers but everyone was excited about the event so the games didn t all take the same length of time but that s ok hanamikoji was perhaps the most cryptic at first but then everyone got a handle on it pentago despite the simplicity of it the strategy eluded them too much each game i played i won in the fewest possible moves they just couldn t figure out how to stop anybody so people just walked into easy wins but they liked it kingdomino really shined we played x one of the casual gamers got two low scores in the s then got in his third play of it by which we was quite pleased onitama was possibly the least popular i think that s because it s tighter and more compressed and less forgiving if you lose a trade but overall they really liked the format they liked being able to get repeated plays in and improve in each game my record was but i don t count the young gamer won the event the other had records of amp but fun was had by all we held a micro game tournament on saturday here s how it went

1,hello like everyone subscribed to this subreddit i have a board game living in my head that i d love to play however designing it would take quite some time so i ll describe it as briefly as possible and maybe there are some similar games out there that i can play instead of making this amp xb theme medieval fantasy you and your crew friends party are enjoying some free time at a local festival when you hear about a dragon that lives not far off thinking that the of you are up for the task you set off to slay the dragon but you re not in it for the adventure or the wealth you re in it for the glory gameplay overview battle through a series of encounters with the th and final encounter being the dragon if you defeat the dragon the game is completed the winner is the player that has earned themselves the most glory through pulling off character class combat specific feats throughout all encounters mechanics players choose a race and a class each offers unique abilities and stats after each successful encounter the character levels up and the player can choose one additional ability from their race tree and one from class tree there is no board for the combat to take place on rather the players declare their move and their target in a determined turn order some moves abilities may have longer cool downs than others to prevent spamming the enemy is autonomous and their moves are chosen by rolling a die and moving and indicator on a rondel the glory as mentioned above winning the game means slaying the dragon and having the most to boast about when you get back this allows players to have independent and potentially contradictory personal goals that they want to complete while all sharing the common goal of passing the encounter it isn t all about killing either a cleric class might gain glory through healing allies while a tank class might gain glory by pulling aggro amp xb that s my brief explanation of what i ve got going on upstairs it is a lot more flushed out but i want to know what people think of it and maybe more importantly if this is something that already exists thank you very much for reading how does this idea sound to you and does it already exist

1,hey all i finally got around to re organizing my collection and i felt pretty proud about my tetris ing here is a list of all the games in the photo from left to right top row bohnanza don t play it enough the game is good if there are competing negotiations but that only happens with a lot of people with a high player count i would opt to play something else coup silly bluffing game it made me realize that i m not a big fan of bluffing games you either lie or you don t lie that s the whole mechanic cyclades out of the matagot trilogy this is the one i ve gotten most on the table and it s my favorite by a slim margin with inis and kemet tied for second the best part of the game in my opinion is the auctioning step so i don t see the appeal in the expansion that takes the focus away from that looking at you titans love letter quick and easy i use it as a drinking game blockus only a player version that i got from below did you know they now sell things for over five dollars it s ridiculous borderline blasphemous it s fun but every time i play the game i m worried i will lose a piece and render the game worthless i can t afford to lose my five dollars boggle truly the superior word game it s abstract none of that scrabble un lucky letter draw bs dallas sa lad mr lister s quiz shootout someone got this game for me as a birthday gift and i have no idea what to do with it trivia game where teams list as many things under the trivia category no it s not scattegories they legally can t call it that source i m an attorney deception murder in hong kong one of my favorite things about board games is player interaction i have a problem with the idea of one person being silent the whole time plus some of the clues are not helpful in any circumstance i like it better than vanilla mafia but i would opt for a different game inis i like the mechanics of this game a lot it was actually one of my favorite games in my collection at one point in time codenames another game that requires a key person to be completely silent the game is fun but i imagine the experience is very dependent on who is giving the guesses after dinner trivia basic deck of trivia cards not worth opining on forget it hidden in top row push your luck dice rolling game got it for free not sure what to do with it jaipur hidden in top row i actually was a victim to a knock off version purchase of jaipur still it s an awesome player game check it out on board game arena if you don t know anything about it middle row quantum it s fun and gets on the table a lot but the upgrade cards are wildly imbalanced some would argue that is just part of the game and in part is what makes it fun others would say that the cosmic encounter argument does not apply to all imbalanced games santorini there is a reason why it s so highly rated on bsg playing it either purely as an abstract or adding in the cards is always a good time i ve never had a bad time playing santorini dominion og edition i ve played it too much to want to keep playing it especially when i don t have any expansions viticulture this is one game that i always want to play but rarely get onto the table i try to pick my games based on new mechanics cyclades for auction kemet for area control bsg for traitor mechanic and this fills the spot on the shelf for worker placement the mechanic of splitting up meeples between two phases of a round is really smart and makes the game a real original i never played it with a full play count but i wanna citadels this game i have played with a full play count and sitting around waiting for the draft to come to you is agonizing i wouldn t play it with more than for that reason and yet it would also not be fun to play it with less than fun game when you do get to go based on anecdotal data the player card successfully snipes a player about of the time arctic scavengers this is a game that does not get enough love both from me and from the board game community it had its minutes of fame when big box came out and then it fell off the face of the earth i would play it over base game dominion container this is my most recently purchased game and the one game i have not yet played if you periodically scour the internet you can find at least one store that sells any oop game except y know rip bsg and rip all knizia games published before i m excited for a tight economy game though i heard that the economy only runs as well as the players in it i hope my friends are smart enough bottom row quoridor snagged this at a thrift store this is my favorite thrift store find it s the one of the few games that i own that my wife is open to playing so it holds a special place in my heart i feel like i play the strategy all wrong which is why i m afraid to play the game competitively on board game arena my strategy at least works well enough to beat my wife at the game bad choice of words so i ll keep my blissful ignorance monopoly every once in a while i play this game by myself just rolling and buying as a form of meditation as an actual game there are a lot of flaws but you guys know that already for example people who go last are immediately at a disadvantage there should be an oscillating order of turns whatever the official name for that is like in the beginning of settlers of catan things in wooden box don t play it a lot there are other party games worth playing instead snake oil like this game i have not laughed harder than when i play snake oil my favorite part about this game is that as a fellow introvert it gives me the structure and forum for practicing extroversion splendor i like it but i m terrible at it i think the problem is that when a new card is flipped it is something pretty and shiny and i want it so i scrap my entire plan to go for that new card hive haven t played it in a long while but back in the day it s all i played i think it s a modern classic bang the dice game this is one of those games that i just don t get it s a hidden role game but the roles become immediately apparent whether you are helping or shooting the sheriff i ve resigned it to drinking game status hansa teutonica there are two people in the world people who have played hansa teutonica and the plebs it satisfies my fetish for emulating a th century german merchant kemet i m all about area control games el grande is on my to buy list there is one problem with it though when teaching people the game new players don t get a hang for which powers are good and which are not part of their strategy by the time they do get it the game is over and i ve never been in a situation where people want to play the game twice in a row once people get beyond that hump it is a tight game that finishes way faster than you anticipate survive escape from atlantis with expansion it s silly and fun if and when i have kids this will be one of the first games i will bring to the proverbial and literal table otherwise it s a little too random for my tastes chess backgammon checkers set chess cool checkers dumb i don t get backgammon it seems like towards the end game it always comes down to a specific dice roll not pictured obviously couldn t fit in this shelf tigris and euphrates this was my favorite game that i owned until i bought hansa teutonica this game is brutal based on my personal plays there appears to be a runaway leader problem especially playing with players but when a huge upset does happen it makes the game on that note i ve been in the closet for a while now but i think i feel comfortable enough with you all to come out and say it i like yellow amp yangtze more more stuff happens more player interaction call me a glutton but i like more battlestar galactica with daybreak expansion traitor games and bluffing games require people who can really bluff and trait when you play with people who can do that the game is great when you play with people who say i m a cylon on turn well it s meh in terms of expansions i wish i got exodus over daybreak tsuro of the seas tsuro in general is too random for me you can only think one or two steps ahead based on your draw at least tsuro of the seas leans into the randomness more i resigned it to a drinking game drink on dragon drink on dragon hope you enjoy been in the community for about a decade here s what i got

1,hey first time i m posting on this community and honestly probably the last as well i m sure this isn t the first post about this game but i want to talk about sh cd so for the little backstory i was shocked recently to find how much i truly appreciate mystery novels books games etc and after a little digging i found this game the more i read about it the more i was interested and excited and so i inevitably went to buy at the local store where luckily it was available to talk about the game sherlock holmes consulting detective is a fascinating and extremely fun experience even alone and i don t regret having played it at all but please if you play it don t make the same mistake as i did and don t expect to win or even coming close to winning for that matter in the game you play as wiggins and his friends as they try to solve mysteries in direct competition with sherlock holmes there is absolutely no hand holding and you have to figure out most of the game by yourself you advance by following leads essentially paragraphs describing what happens when you go to a certain location and thus gain more and more clues you also have access to the newspaper of the day and friendly advice don t forget you can also check old newspapers as well it can be extremely important then at the end just check the last pages try to answer the final questions about what really happened and read holmes s conclusions on the matter you get more points by answering the questions correctly and some points will also be retrieved from your score for every lead you follow after holmes s number of leads ex holmes went to places and solved the mystery you went to and didn t solve it entirely you now get x points since you visited more places than him and add the number of points you gained from questions theoretically you win by having as much if not more points than holmes who always sets the bar at it can only be achieved by answering correctly to every main question and answering correctly to at least one of the secondary objectives now for the sake of morale and self confidence i recommend you forget everything i just wrote about scoring truly the game is at it s peak when you try to piece everything together without getting criticized by the game for taking to much leads and that s something i wished i knew before finishing it in conclusion when it comes to the game how it s designed and thought of easy or especially if you re into solving mysteries however while i do understand being able to do better than sherlock must have boosted lots of players s ego mine was shattered for trying to rush the investigations and never actually reaching this satisfying moment of solving everything all that because i tried to stay competitive with sherlock friggin holmes except for case i liked case but it was probably one of the easiest so for everyone that has played the game i d like to know what you think although please keep spoilers in gt spoiler text lt for everyone that hasn t i recommend you check it out by yourself and with some friends because even if i played it alone the game can easily be enjoyed with some friends as for me i definitely plan to check out the other shcd games or extensions one day gonna have let this one sink in first tho have a good day sherlock holmes consulting detective is a great game with the side effect of making you hate yourself
1,i got myself a copy of cosmic last year and i fell in love with the game ever since i got to play it the first time it kinda feels like a quirkier board game version of magic the gathering to me and i adore it i d love to get into some of the expansions now but as i m a poor student i have to pace myself buying them so as the title already lead to assume i d love some opinions on which expansions are the best first to get and which ones i can skip thanks a lot best cosmic encounter expansions

1,i like it i have played it alot on my own can t wait to play it with my friends but i don t get the sorcerer he is the only one that does the least amount of damage if you face the cage spider simple lvl monster it is basicly game over since it has defence weakness skilled and health it takes stamina cards and soul arrows cards out of to kill him provided that you drew the right cards so if you are lucky it will still take cards damage card since it takes turns to kill him that is almost half your deck and you lost weapon cards and that is just enemy other classes can keep their weapons while dealing damage so they make atleast some progress against defence enemies can someone tell me how that is balanced dark souls the card game question

1,what are your experiences with movie tie in games in general any stand outs for good bad reasons i played aliens another glorious day in the corps the other day not good aliens is right up there in favourite film territory so i was very excited to get my hands on this it looks great it feels great it s got hicks and ripley and vasquez and you get the point but me and all three of my friends pretty much hated it i don t think we got it we found the manual quite impenetrable and there s a mechanic where you spend resource cards to use ammo for your weapons and if you use it all up you re dead yet you re being swamped by aliens so you have to shoot umm so yeah we bounced off it quite hard indeed we play plenty of complicated games like kingdom death monster and gloomhaven so i don t think it was user error just something about the combination of some poorly written rules and a distasteful mechanic utterly killed off four very keen board gamers real shame i haven t really played many other direct movie adaptations so was wondering what sort of experiences you guys have had good bad movie tie in board games
1,i have been playing catan with friends for over years i m looking for a suggestion to buy a new game that doesn t have to be completely similar to catan but that it still contains some features like the luck factor rolling the dice for example strategy etc up to players teams thank you which board game to buy next

1,i ve always been interested in train games like the xx series but feel like my group friends would be too intimidated by it s complexity so i bought irish gauge to fill the train games spot in my collection after playing it for a while i ve always felt bad while playing it and i feel it s the auction that feels kinda random whenever someone feels like it and forces the group to gobble up the shares in the first few turns then after that the game just flows with little chance for comeback or at least the threat of it i know it might just be the fault of the group but even when it doesn t happen the flow just feels off back to the point of the thread this review by npi has got me interested in iberian gauge which have a specific turn where the stock buying happen and seems to be an improvement on the flow of irish gauge so the question is should i sell my copy of irish gauge for a copy of iberian gauge or maybe their other games ride the rails is better or are there any other light train non ticket to ride ones that i should get preferably around the price range of irish iberian gauge what are your thoughts on my experience with irish gauge is it just me or am i doing something wrong irish gauge vs iberian gauge or other train games
1,i know some people here have but if you go searching through the posts for the name of the game you get very few threads it s crazy how when i was getting into the hobby magic realm was a grail game an obtuse and lumbering beast for sure but one that many modern gamers had heard of even if they had not played i m wondering what people today know about it have you played it or seen it or even heard of it i have my copy but have never worked up the dedication to play maybe one day anyone played magic realm

1,ive been reading some posts about lcgs and i see a lot of people agreeing that lcg is better for cooperative than competitive play i think what people mean with competitive is buying an lcg box or multiple drafting a deck and go to a tournament where people have done the same and then battle each other i can understand why this isn t ideal for an lcg because you need buy every expansion there is to be competitive however no one mentions the option of competitive casual play for lack of a better term what i mean by that is i buy an lcg where the goal is to destroy each other i invite friends who ve never played this game i hand them a starter deck and we re good to go non cooperative style so what i m asking is why is it that no one mentions this option and are there really big downsides to this i m not familiar with a lot of lcgs so i have no examples of what i m talking about but i m wondering its viability cheers lcg question
1,i recently introduced some friends to my board game hobby and they have already settled that blood rage is their favorite normally this would be great as i love the game however they have a problem with one of the rules the drafting they don t like the drafting and said they would rather just be dealt the cards i personally think that drafting the cards at the beginning of each age is the most important part of the game as you get to choose how you want to play the round and can get combinations of cards that work together for maximum points i asked them why they didn t want to do the drafting and they all said that they are afraid of drafting the wrong cards and that if they get bad cards its their fault so they would rather just be dealt the cards how do i get past this if i feel like the quality of games are far lower as well as the points and the amount of strategy as you can get cards that are completely contradictory in their goals blood rage friend group rules problem
1,howdy all i m new here but have been enjoying quality board games for a few decades i have a limited amount of storage space due to frequent travel relocation and am currently trying to pair down the volume space wise of my collection in short i want to keep my current games but not within their oem oversized boxes i assume that many of the users here have some great strategies for doing so i m a bit of an organizer and detest throwing things in bags loose boxes i desire to have a clean look with the original artwork logos but preferably in a uniform small ish size in short of like for them to look great on a bookshelf i m happy to take a diy approach but amn t exceptionally skilled at such i m working on a college instructor s budget i ve seen some fun things on etsy and the like but some of the games which i m attempting to shrink are titles such as carcassonne w expansions balderdash and catan w expansions i m curious as to what solutions you all have reached and any input would be much appreciated thank you board game storage box solutions

1,this past weekend i was at dragoncon with a few friends in atlanta ga we wandered to the floor above board games and stumbled across a game called battlequest three people were running it taught us our to play and we played a couple times from the talks it sounded like one or more of the three people created the game does anyone know it if you can buy the rules or how to get in touch with the creators more on the game to help it was played on a x grid if i remember correctly players grid was filled with terrain and it seemed like everytime different and any terrain could be used players choose a character sheet warrior knight priest mageblade or wizard you randomly choose two primary enemies and a secondary minion troop enemy to fight against then you use notecards to help develop a backstory for the battle the fight and role play a bit there are more to the rules but hope that helps thank you has anyone heard of battlequest

1,first i want to begin by thanking everyone for all of your ideas and votes they didn t stop coming until the very end seeing this level of support has energized us to work hard to put this product into your hands quickly but more on that later on to the results art styles th century watercolor s heavy metal fantasy art themes gene splicing cooking mechanics variable player powers reverse deck building we re already going crazy coming up with interesting ideas to piece this all together the art styles will take quite a bit of researching and experimentation to work together but it should be doable the themes oddly enough work very well together in one obvious direction genetically engineered yummies but we are still exploring other options the mechanics are on the more complicated end of options but we re up for the challenge they will definitely require lots of testing to get right so once we have a prototype ready we re going to need your feedback so what s the plan now the plan is to build a high quality and completely free print and play game for all of you in color with full quality art and any music that accompanies it as digital download for those who would like a manufactured copy with quality components we will set up a kickstarter to fund the print run in the months to come there s a lot of hard work to do but we should have a low art prototype in a month s time hopefully less so stay tuned for that update post in order to gather feedback we also plan on setting up a discord server but give us some time with that as we re still a bit rough around the edges with discord we ll post an update here when that s ready if you d like more constant updates you can follow us on our newly minted social media pages we ll try to update bi weekly and we ll be asking for feedback so if you want to have your say please join us for now we have a small post explaining why we chose our name and how all of you had an influence in that too finally we have one last surprise as a special thank you to the users who provided the winning posts you ll get a free copy of the physical game when the kickstarter version comes out check your inboxes in a few minutes for a message from us you asked for it and now we ll make it real results from the collaborative pitch and what comes next
1,played honeycomb a lightweight tile laying game the kids and years old grokked it immediately no setup time no complicated rules there are three gameplay versions included we did version b ha place a tile score points draw new tile pass the included storage bag repeat until all pieces played the family liked this game because the theme is adorable and the gameplay can be ha again as strategic as one wants point and place sure think moves ahead absolutely plot when you use your special steal move piece to maximize points and snub the other player the opportunity yup but fair warning that one is mighty tricky to pull off and could result in a hurt feelings report i haven t yet played with older folks but frankly this feels like a great alternative to dominos while enjoying zesty beverages and charred meats pattern matching is ageless fun bottom line this game is fun the component quality is top notch and it is still good even when the kids misplace a piece or three a quick and fun game family or otherwise
1,i just got a copy of santorini and the primary language on the box is english with what i presume to be french also translated on the back text there are rulebooks for english and french but the god power cards are only in french not that it s a big deal as it s only the name of the god and the name is more or less the same as english but it kinda bothers me so i was curious if i just got a weird copy and if i can find an easy replacement santorini cards not in english

1,despite having played board games at home for over a decade and having always supported the flgss in the various cities i ve lived in i have never attended any of the events organized by them i feel generally pretty clumsy and awkward in social situations and often have a hard time interacting with people i just met given i am in my s that s not very cute just weird tonight i want to attend my very first board game night at a local game store but i am feeling awfully nervous i will go there alone and i am not sure how to go about it all if i bring a game i want to play i probably won t invite people to the table to play for the fear of bothering them and if i go without a game i would feel awkward about inserting myself in a group playing a game how do these things usually go any tip for how to navigate this situation without making it so stressful i hope this post isn t too off topic how to attend a game night if you re socially awkward

1,hey all my wife and i have loved board games for years and have a number of them unfortunately for the last years or so we haven t been able to play them at least not often she has stomach issues which include her liver and sitting upright for more than a half hour causes her a lot of pain we have a couch with a chaise that she can lean back in and it s where she spends a lot of her time we ve tried playing games on the coffee table but she either has to sit up or lean way forward to reach the board i m wondering if there s anything out there that might be an appropriate height and with a big enough overhang so it can pull right up to her we d still be able to put chairs around and most healthy people like myself have no problem leaning forward a bit even if it s a touch low budget is a concern so even someone that s made or has a good idea for such a table i d love to know i m not handy at all but my father still has a workshop and he d give me a hand building something if i had a decent idea what i wanted thank you in advance for any help or advice looking for a low gaming table suitable for a person who can t sit upright

0,i recently remembered about a pretty fun game i used to play a few years ago and wanted to play it again but i can t remember the name at all and since i changed phone since then i can t look up my download history for it old phone is gone sadly i used to play it on an iphone but i remember seeing it on the play store but kinda just ignored it needless to say i regret it now after typing random key words in the research bar to try and find it i decided that i ll probably only be able to find the game if i describe it as well as i can so i ll just do that i ll add a next to things if i m not too sure about it first of all it was fantasy themed the first playable character you had access to was a knight but later you could unlock other classes such as a spellcaster and a rogue monsters were your generic fantasy enemies like slimes bats trying to pour cauldrons filled with dangerous stuff on you dragons and zombies and at some point you d fight a boss like a minotaur an imp a giant slime or a plant boss which you would fight respectively in plains mountains graveyard and jungle i don t think i ever made it further than that though the art style was pixelated during gameplay the top part of the screen would show the game wow and the lower part was made to look something like a nes controller with left and right arrows the action button and a pause button probably gameplay wise it was rather simple buttons a button to move left one for right and one for action that action changes depending on your character but most of the time it was a jump you would start each run in a wide open area and enemies would start spawning everywhere i could be wrong but i remember your character constantly moving in one direction not being able to stop you would then try to kill enemies to survive until eventually the boss for the level you re in appears fight it and move to the next level after winning defeating a boss rewards you with a big chest i m pretty sure if you were playing as the knight he would hold his blade in front of him damaging anyone who touches it and your action was a jump the spellcaster however couldn t jump and instead would cast a spell when pressing the action button last thing i remember is that there were mini objectives to try and complete during each run things like kill x amount of one enemy and such you could only have at the same time it s very similar to something you d see in games like jetpack joyride and that s all i remember hopefully i didn t forget something important thanks in advance for the help need help to find a specific game

0,the game is a sort of tower defence where there is a campaign but also a sandbox i think the defenders are human and the attackers are undead you can control an avatar from a rd person pov and they have different avatars paladin and assasin are just i remember but you can buy troops like miners and archers to defend the walls while using your own abilities to destroy the attackers i think the avatars have upgradable cards and abilities and some avatars must be bought with irl money the general story of the game is that the kingdom is isolated and the king is dying in the game the first defence is walls and if they get broken then attackers can attack the keep and then if that is broken you lose it s very vague but the icon i think looked like some walls of a castle with the name overlayed in front furthermore i ll give a short explanation of what i remember it looking like the keep and walls sit at one end of a field that is enclosed on sides by short mountains about the height of the walls of the castle while the end the attackers on has a lot of dead trees and fog i m sorry that this sounds so random and generic but any help would be appreciatedtrying to find an old game

0,one reason why my android phone is an emulation machine instead of playing native games is precisely this reason i would rather play doom via delta touch which offers me full mappable controls rather than the official one on play store due this the fire button on the official version is at the same height where my right finger is used to control the camera and having to lower raise to to avoid hitting that stupid button causes my finger to cramp same goes for titan quest even if there is an option to increase the ui settings there are no options to move it and the action attack button is all the way to the right edge of my device that i have to support the right side of my device with my pinky instead of palm just to hit it was initially interested to play the outlast clones on the play store too but also the same bullshit applies in these games too so my question is why is it so hard to allow the option to adjust the icon to another part of the touchscreen why do mobile game developers find it so hard to offer re mappable touchscreen controls

0,i ll start off with the obvious yes this is an rpg simulation game anyways i got an early access invite from the developer and i put a few days into this game now and i m constantly impressed with it i ve played quite a few rpg simulation games on mobile through the years and i really wouldn t make a thread for most of them due to it falling really quickly into the pattern of most mobile rpg simulation where the gameplay is minimal but for mafia connect the gameplay part that i think this one does really well so you can run and expand a variety of business form alliances with other forces and take on stronger foes just as other rpg simulation games does but what s really hooked me the most of everything is the unique battle mechanism players may need to formulate their move in each battle specifically around boss battles in the latter half that require you to think and act accordingly instead of just spend your skills or make random moves to be honest i really find a lot of fun on this rpg simulation game and mafia connect is going to hold an open beta test soon if you are looking for a time killing game that worth to play with maybe you can give it a try amp xb of the most endearing mobile games i ve ever played

0,i m looking for a fp lords mobile game lookin for a game
0,i always see the same stuff on there and searching for random things isn t funare there any good alternatives to the google play store
0,i started playing that game days ago it s basicaly a scavenging and survival game with some decent story the gameplay isn t attrociously bad but there are quite a few scummy things the company has done at this game that are infuriating first off the traveling between base to locations is like the goodgame empire travelling but much worse your base could be touching the other location and you need minutes for free to walk or around energy to run to get there instantly energy caps at and for every milimeter the location is away the energy price and time needed to get there rises expotentialy secondly the game is filled with bots that are made specifically to make sure you will die and have to purchase items from the store you enter a stage farm slowly kill off the enemies and somehow out of nowhere a damned wolf bear or even damned knights will appear homing in on you from across the map from a spot you had already cleared out and this only happens when you are farming materials opening chests or just after you open a chest and the chest inventory is covering your screen not to mention the players who somehow always know exactly where you are and will always have full health with almost no equipment except for a very strong weapon really and not only that but they may deal dmg to you and will keep hitting you until they are hit away from death at that moment they will turn away snd run all across the map to get out of the region even if the region border is just behind them they also never appear near you but on the other corner of the map just outside of your map window yeah right thirdly upon death you lose all your stuff this isn t the infuriating part about it i mean it is supposed to be a survival game what is pissing me off is that the first time you die the stuff is left there after that you will always lose everything but the game never explains that and once you respawn in base you get an ad and get forcefully transported to the microtransactions store no matter what you press like are these greedy cunts even trying to hide their greed at that point you aldo need a huge ass time to craft stuff and you can watch ads to fasten that process or pay silver coins that ypu can only buy remember that store i mentioned it also sells items which are mostly lockedeither between lootboxes or overpriced bundles annnnnd these weapons break within hits each enemy needs at least hit if your weapon deals less than damage and sone need even up to hits with a dmg weapon so the weapons break within minutes depending on the area you re in and if you die you lose them nice it isn t to further force you to buy items the game has locked the crafting of items behind leveling which is extremely hard if you don t have a weapon however to craft a weapon stronger than a weak ass dmg wooden club you need to be at least lvl and for basic clothes you need to be lvl the first dagger you get to craft is at lvl all in all the game is fun as survival but all these mechanics that are made just to force you to die and have to buy items are disgusting unless your dad is an arab khalif or you own the company that made that penis shaped rocket for bezoss i d recommend you avoid this game due to how costly it is grim soul the most paywin survival game

0,the era of mobile gaming has brought with it one of the more divisive genres in gaming mobas from dota to league of legends surely you ve heard of it if not played it yourself v pvp with a mix of pve and objective based gameplay can lead to an addictive experience and mobile has caught up but not really today i want to rank most not all especially the ones with downloads of the mobile mobas let s start with the most popular then mobile legends bang bang synopsis mobile legends bang bang offers the classic league of legends clone feel while offering new twists overall it is a solid moba that is hurt by being pw with emblems and unlocking champions a common theme as we will see among mobile mobas rating b explanation it would have been a c if it weren t for the fact that matches are very quick to get into and it seems to have the most stable and large player base among mobile mobas if long queu times or playing bots aren t your thing then this is the moba for you doubly so if you have deep pockets league of legends wild rift synopsis lol wild rift is somehow the mobile version of league of legends that feels like a clone anyone that has played actual lol will find this game awkward and unfamiliar despite having the same characters and general gameplay overall it is not pw and is very generous in giving out champions and even skins rating b explanation the biggest knock on the rating for lol wild rift are a few things actually wait times a toxic player base long matches much longer than other mobile mobas and harsh extremely harsh punishments for say going afk or setting your phone down to drink coffee and not seeing the play button on your queu so now you have to wait minute to queu again it also has a higher skill cap than other mobile mobas and the controls for certain champions can be extremely difficult to do on a phone screen i e it s not noob friendly arena of valor synopsis another lol clone that has declined in player base in recent years it also is pw in the same cane as mlbb with runes that players can slot and buy not as pw though as you can earn these through gameplay and they aren t as game changing rating c explanation aov used to be great ahead of the rest imo in recent times though the greed of devs and the decline of player base has made the game toxic and lacking looking at pure gameplay though it is fun if you can look past playing bots over and over legends of ace synopsis a lol clone and a boring one at that rating d explanation small player base little polish and boring copy cat gameplay with little creativity makes it one of the worse mobas to play mobile extraordinary ones synopsis a colorful anime themed moba that is fast paced and offers hot new takes on the genre it suffers from a small player base outside asia otherwise it would be by far the best mobile moba rating a explanation would be an a if they cared to advertise the game in the west and increase player base it is still a lot of fun just to play casual but ranked is impossible at the moment outside of asia servers i recommend that the game takes the mlbb server approach and allow players to play with anyone around the world onymoji arena synopsis beautiful moba that lacks player base rating b explanation a bit more traditional and clone ish than eo but just as beautiful in graphics and has a bit more player base overall not a bad choice but not the best vainglory synopsis a dead moba not much else to say it is very dead rating n a explanation have barely played the game outside of a few matches wait times are absurd and the player base is low low low devs gave up months ago on updates too conclusion for the west you want to play mlbb or wild rift honestly the best choices for ranked play if you want something unique and special i highly recommend extraordinary ones if you can stand the wait times because honestly it s worth it imo but others maybe not so much mobile moba ranking

0,i picked up a used iphone xr from a friend who just got a newer model he gave me a great deal to try out some apple exclusive timed exclusive mobile games i was thinking of picking up a thunderbolt to hdmi converter eventually but decided to do screen mirroring temporarily to get the image up on my tv and i would just deal with the downsides but it ended up being pretty much flawless in my initial use now i ve tried a few wireless game streaming solutions including a raspberry pi steamlink app steam link hardware miracast and chromecast they ve all worked with varying degrees of competency with steam link being the best and miracast being the worst however the steamlink required some fine tuning to get the right balance of picture quality bandwidth and input lag with higher bandwidth settings paradoxically sometimes increasing input lag and the controller not always working all of this background information i feel is necessary to convey my surprise at apple s solution i just clicked screen mirroring on my phone my vizio tv popped up and the game was there my controller was connected via bluetooth and i sat the phone down on the table and just played i made no attempt to pixel count but at my normal sitting distance the image was crisp even on a k tv although i was playing a slower paced rpg fantasian the input lag was low enough that i never had a sense of disconnect between my button presses and the actions on screen now with all that in mind this solution may fall apart in games that require more input speed precision like a platformer but if it does i ll just pick up an hdmi adapter briefly tried out gaming via screen mirroring on my smart tv with iphone and the seamlessness and lack of input lag surprised me

0,so i just found black desert online and honkai impact i am wondering if these games actually take skill to play i see that in blo you can just hit the auto button then i m just watching the computer play the game but that being said the hack and slash features don t seem that complicated anyways so even if i had an ounce of discipline which i don t it d still just be hack and slash for honkai it seems similar in hack and slash there s a bit of needing to know the rock paper scissors of fighter types but other than that it seems to boil down to character level if your character is strong enough you can hack and slash anything without giving it much thought i quit my hero academy for the same reason am i wrong i just started these games so i m looking for people who have played through and can say if the difficulty increases i m using genshin as the golden standard here knowing how to combo and get in and out of skirmishes means you can t just plow through the game genshin wasn t hard but if you are skilled it goes much smoother if these two games don t require skill are there any games out there that do besides genshin rpg that takes skill to play

0,hey there a long time ago i played a mobil game that i cannot remember the tittle of and it is bugging me because i cannot seem to find a trace of it on the internet if one of you might know that would be awesome i remember enjoying it and wanted to revisit it so what i do remember is that it is a turned base game with a team of characters i swear it had monster in the title but i could be wrong since i couldn t google search it it definitely had monsters in it though as vampires and lycanthropes were class types you could collect monsters by summoning them through tarot cards i think or completing story beats one of the characters i think was a singing vampire whose specials was healing specials would charge up on a set of attacks and once used you would have to draw a symbol to determine how powerful it would be the better you drew the stronger the heal or attack it auto attacked and attack time was based on speed the art style was very nice sorry that wasn t very helpful however the first character you get is a young boy with red brown hair and a golden sword he is human i think the nd character you get through the story is a slow but powerful attacking robot they held an event once where you could get krampus if that helps the plot of the story if i remember correctly was that you are fighting your way up a mountain on which the top of is something evil an eye or a light house i can t remember there was stamina but not in the battle system it was outside that dictated how many you could fight and had a timer until you got more energy thank you so much help to remember an old game

0,i personally despise the mobile gaming world that said i do not want this to come off and shaming people who do play them or spend on them but i feel its important to warn people because some of these games are super addictive and can certainly get people to spend needlessly these are in no particular order and feel free to make suggestions if you disagree at least try and be civil about it and explain why try to enjoy the game without spending first like it or not when it comes to mobile games your entertainment is not their first priority you should always install a game and play it for free for at least a month or so just to see how stingy the game actually is with energy resources pulls etc if they do not value their non paying players then you can be assured they only value you as long as you keep forking them the dough give yourself a budget even if you are having a good time on a game you should def give yourself a budget and stick to it try and look at what you are actually buying most games dont even sell you new content often your money is going towards speeding up the grind or getting a unit you already own to a higher star rating or something else you should not support spending your hard earned money on such insignificant things and if you do def limit yourself there will always be a better player no matter how much you spend does your money even get you want you want in gacha style games its not uncommon for people to whale out only to not get the big tier unit anyway its much better to buy something you want and get exactly that whenever you add rng into the mix consider it a bad purchase and expect to be disapointed loot boxes are a cute name for gambling whens the last time you hit the loto or or a jackpot in vegas watch videos online of people cracking loot boxes the first time i watched a legit whale i was blown away by how little his whale session actually got him it really is eye opening to see someone else throw their money away sure they may have a lot of money that does not mean you should be willy nilly with it nostalgia yes i love tmnt and a bunch of other stuff from the s s that does not mean i should throw money at everything with that liscense a bad game is a bad game and spending your money on it wont make it better make sure you are actually enjoying the game and getting what you want out of it always remember mobile games are designed to make you spend the term free to play isnt exactly factual sure you can play but you will never get any where without spending they are free to install and thats about the extent of it i think its important to make sure people are cautious with mobile games so i wrote up a little thing to help people maybe spend less or avoid wasting money

0,hello everybody recently i started playing a game called years life simulator it s supposed to be a choose your own story kind of game where your character age at each level and each level is in fact a choice you have to make however i realize that choice don t really seem to matter that much at some point and was wondering if peoples who played this game could help me confirm a theory at level one of your choice can send you into a loop which make you start the lvl over and over again i was wondering if someone who recently started the game and is around this level could try staying in the loop the longest possible to see if it affects the game secretly i have a low intentions span and only did the loop time my theory is that these loops level another is around lvl are in fact there to change some hidden stats which can open other route down the road the game tree show other branches but so far none of my action allowed me to acces them of course there is also the possibility that the game is in fact linear to that point ps the theory come from the fact that i saw a youtube video where the youtuber did the lvl more than me the lvl oops is basically waking up and going to school which start the loop or just skipping school and i saw a slight difference in the choice down the road it lead him to the same story than me but the wording of the choice seemed more detailed at some point almost like the character was smarter this noticeably happened at mevel where your character is asked by his boss to come at her home to repair her coffee machine once accepted and the machine repaired she will ask for a massage doing it will end up with you being fired since it s inapripria and against the corporation rules to do so the other choice in my game was simply no as the whole choice was simply the word no while this youtuber had a more elaborate choice saying that it was inappropriate like his choice was a complete sentence years life simulator need help

0,hey all so i ve done the rounds across countless gacha games for years played ffbe another eden and dq tactics for a long time and free games on the app store done the rounds on apple arcade and couldn t really find something fun to play couple of months ago i decided to buy stardew valley and my mind was blown it was such an amazing game that played so well even on a phone that i ended up playing it more than my ps what i really enjoyed about it however was not so much the farming sim but rather really easy to pick up and put down at any time so if i have short bursts of time between meetings or waiting for something etc i can just start the game and play a little bit since it quick saves everytime you quit a little buggy sometimes but generally ok not only can i play in short bursts but if i want to sit down and have a long play session for hours or on commute it s equally rewarding and fun playing it feels super relaxing and while in the beginning you tend to feel rushed everyday eventually it s really relaxing when you have a good idea how to go about every day there s no sense of stress at all and if you really want to you can just restart a day or two i ve played many games like tower defense from ironhide studios and i just feel stressed and unfun every time mobs break through the setup and i gotta replay like mins of the stage once you get a hang of the game you don t need to have laser focus on the game and you can play it while multi tasking like watching news or commuting on public transport i ve played lots of games where it basically demands your undivided attention which many times i just don t have that attention to give lastly it s replayability i spent and sunk at least hours into it across playthroughs and enjoyed every minute of it so it seems like a tall order but basically i m looking for a fun and relaxing game then i can either pick up and play in short bursts or play for a long stretch if i want to i m up for any kind of game like free paid or gacha and any kind of genrelooking for a game like stardew valley but not quite
